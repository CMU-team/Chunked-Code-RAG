{"text": "Q: How to modify non-configurable, non-writable properties in Javascript? I'm writing a simple EventEmitter is ES5.\nThe objective is to ensure that all properties on EventEmitter instances are\nnon-writable and non-configurable.\"\nAfter 6 hours of racking my brain I still can't figure out how to, increase the listenerCount, for example if the configurable descriptor is set to false.\nHere's an example of what I have:\nvar eventEmitter = function(){\n  var listeners = listeners || 0;\n  var events = events || {};\n\n  Object.defineProperties(this, {\n   listeners: {\n    value : 0,\n    configurable: false,\n    writable: false\n  },\n  events: {\n    value: {},\n    configurable : false,\n    writable: false\n    }\n  });\n  return this;\n};\n\n\neventEmmitter.prototype.on = function(ev, cb) {\n  if (typeof ev !== 'string') throw new TypeError(\"Event should be type string\", \"index.js\", 6);\n  if (typeof cb !== 'function' || cb === null || cb === undefined) throw new TypeError(\"callback should be type function\", \"index.js\", 7);\n\n  if (this.events[ev]){\n    this.events[ev].push(cb);\n  } else {\n    this.events[ev] = [cb];\n  }\n\n  this.listeners ++;\n  return this;\n};\n\n\nA: I would recommend the use of an IIFE (immediatly invoked function expression):\nvar coolObj=(function(){\nvar public={};\nvar nonpublic={};\nnonpublic.a=0;\npublic.getA=function(){nonpublic.a++;return nonpublic.a;};\n\nreturn public;\n})();\n\nNow you can do:\ncoolObj.getA();//1\ncoolObj.getA();//2\ncoolObj.a;//undefined\ncoolObj.nonpublic;//undefined\ncoolObj.nonpublic.a;//undefined\n\nI know this is not the answer youve expected, but i think its the easiest way of doing sth like that.\n\nA: You can use a proxy which requires a key in order to define properties:\n\n\nfunction createObject() {\r\n  var key = {configurable: true};\r\n  return [new Proxy({}, {\r\n    defineProperty(target, prop, desc) {\r\n      if (desc.value === key) {\r\n        return Reflect.defineProperty(target, prop, key);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }), key];\r\n}\r\nfunction func() {\r\n  var [obj, key] = createObject();\r\n  key.value = 0;\r\n  Reflect.defineProperty(obj, \"value\", {value: key});\r\n  key.value = function() {\r\n    key.value = obj.value + 1;\r\n    Reflect.defineProperty(obj, \"value\", {value: key});\r\n  };\r\n  Reflect.defineProperty(obj, \"increase\", {value: key});\r\n  return obj;\r\n}\r\nvar obj = func();\r\nconsole.log(obj.value); // 0\r\ntry { obj.value = 123; } catch(err) {}\r\ntry { Object.defineProperty(obj, \"value\", {value: 123}); } catch(err) {}\r\nconsole.log(obj.value); // 0\r\nobj.increase();\r\nconsole.log(obj.value); // 1\n\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41069927", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: Handling multiple exceptions I have written a class which loads configuration objects of my application and keeps track of them so that I can easily write out changes or reload the whole configuration at once with a single method call. However, each configuration object might potentially throw an exception when doing IO, yet I do not want those errors to cancel the overall process in order to give the other objects still a chance to reload/write. Therefore I collect all exceptions which are thrown while iterating over the objects and store them in a super-exception, which is thrown after the loop, since each exception must still be handled and someone has to be notified of what exactly went wrong. However, that approach looks a bit odd to me. Someone out there with a cleaner solution? \nHere is some code of the mentioned class:\npublic synchronized void store() throws MultipleCauseException\n    {\n    MultipleCauseException me = new MultipleCauseException(\"unable to store some resources\");\n    for(Resource resource : this.resources.values())\n        {\n        try\n            {\n            resource.store();\n            }\n        catch(StoreException e)\n            {\n            me.addCause(e);\n            }\n        }\n    if(me.hasCauses())\n        throw me;\n    }\n\n\nA: If you want to keep the results of the operations, which it seems you do as you purposely carry on, then throwing an exception is the wrong thing to do. Generally you should aim not to disturb anything if you throw an exception.\nWhat I suggest is passing the exceptions, or data derived from them, to an error handling callback as you go along.\npublic interface StoreExceptionHandler {\n    void handle(StoreException exc);\n}\n\npublic synchronized void store(StoreExceptionHandler excHandler) {\n    for (Resource resource : this.resources.values()) {\n        try {\n            resource.store();\n        } catch (StoreException exc) {\n            excHandler.handle(exc);\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... return normally ... */\n]\n\n\nA: There are guiding principles in designing what and when exceptions should be thrown, and the two relevant ones for this scenario are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction (i.e. the exception translation paradigm)\n\n*Throw exceptions early if possible\n\n\nThe way you translate StoreException to MultipleCauseException seems reasonable to me, although lumping different types of exception into one may not be the best idea. Unfortunately Java doesn't support generic Throwables, so perhaps the only alternative is to create a separate MultipleStoreException subclass instead.\nWith regards to throwing exceptions as early as possible (which you're NOT doing), I will say that it's okay to bend the rule in certain cases. I feel like the danger of delaying a throw is when exceptional situations nest into a chain reaction unnecessarily. Whenever possible, you want to avoid this and localize the exception to the smallest scope possible.\nIn your case, if it makes sense to conceptually think of storing of resources as multiple independent tasks, then it may be okay to \"batch process\" the exception the way you did. In other situations where the tasks has more complicated interdependency relationship, however, lumping it all together will make the task of analyzing the exceptions harder.\nIn a more abstract sense, in graph theory terms, I think it's okay to merge a node with multiple childless children into one. It's probably not okay to merge a whole big subtree, or even worse, a cyclic graph, into one node.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2444580", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

Any ideas why? I was told it would improve by a factor of 2. Am I missing something?\nLastly is there any type of vectorization in Matlab that will allow me to forget about the for loop in the above code?\nThanks,\n\nA: In your code: try with n=10000 and you'll see more of a difference (a factor of almost 10 on my machine).\nThese things related with allocation are most noticeable when the size of your variable is large. In that case it's more difficult for Matlab to dynamically allocate memory for that variable.\n\nTo reduce the number of operations: do it vectorized, and reuse intermediate results to avoid powers:\ny = (1 + x.*(-3/5 + x.*(3/20 - x/60))) ./ (1 + x.*(2/5 - x/20));\n\nBenchmarking:\nWith n=100:\nParag's / venergiac's solution:\n>> tic\nfor count = 1:100\ny=(1-(3/5)*x+(3/20)*x.^2 -(x.^3/60))./(1+(2/5)*x-(1/20)*x.^2);\nend\ntoc\nElapsed time is 0.010769 seconds.\n\nMy solution:\n>> tic\nfor count = 1:100\ny = (1 + x.*(-3/5 + x.*(3/20 - x/60))) ./ (1 + x.*(2/5 - x/20));\nend\ntoc\nElapsed time is 0.006186 seconds.\n\n\nA: You don't need a for loop.

I have tried using geline but still no luck\nEDIT: radius, height, width and side have to be > 0\n\nA: The biggest potential problems you are running up against is the fact that you assume a line is valid if it begins with a c, t or r without first validating the remainder of the line matches the format for a circle, triangle or rectangle. While not fatal to this data set, what happens if one of the lines was 'cat' or 'turtle'?\nBy failing to validate all parts of the line fit the \"mold\" so to speak, you risk attempting to output values of r, h & w or s that were not read from the file. A simple conditional check of the read to catch the potential failbit or badbit will let you validate you have read what you think you read.\nThe remainder is basically semantics of whether you use the niceties of C++ like a vector of struct for rectangles and whether you use a string instead of char*, etc. However, there are certain benefits of using a string to read/validate the remainder of each line (or you could check the stream state and use .clear() and .ignore())\nPutting those pieces together, you can do something like the following. Note, there are many, many different approaches you can take, this is just one approach,\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef struct {        /* simple typedef for vect of rectangles */\n    int width, height;\n} rect_t;\n\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\n\n    vector<double> cir;     /* vector of double for circle radius */\n    vector<double> tri;     /* vector of double for triangle side */\n    vector<rect_t> rect;    /* vector of rect_t for rectangles */\n    string line;            /* string to use a line buffer */\n\n    if (argc < 2) { /* validate at least one argument given */\n        cerr << \"error: insufficient input.\\n\"\n                \"usage: \" << argv[0] << \" filename\\n\";\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    ifstream f (argv[1]);   /* open file given by first argument */\n    if (!f.is_open()) {     /* validate file open for reading */\n        cerr << \"error: file open failed '\" << argv[1] << \"'.\\n\";\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    while (getline (f, line)) {     /* read each line into 'line' */\n        string shape;               /* string for shape */\n        istringstream s (line);     /* stringstream to parse line */\n        if (s >> shape) {           /* if shape read */\n            if (shape == \"c\") {     /* is it a \"c\"? */\n                double r;           /* radius */\n                string rest;        /* string to read rest of line */\n                if (s >> r && !getline (s, rest))  /* radius & nothing else */\n                    cir.push_back(r);   /* add radius to cir vector */\n                else    /* invalid line for circle, handle error */\n                    cerr << \"error: invalid radius or unexpected chars.\\n\";\n            }\n            else if (shape == \"t\") {\n                double l;           /* side length */\n                string rest;        /* string to read rest of line */\n                if (s >> l && !getline (s, rest))  /* length & nothing else */\n                    tri.push_back(l);   /* add length to tri vector */\n                else    /* invalid line for triangle, handle error */\n                    cerr << \"error: invalid triangle or unexpected chars.\\n\";\n            }\n            else if (shape == \"r\") {    /* is it a rect? */\n                rect_t tmp;             /* tmp rect_t */\n                if (s >> tmp.width && s >> tmp.height)  /* tmp & nohtin else */\n                    rect.push_back(tmp);    /* add to rect vector */\n                else    /* invalid line for rect, handle error */\n                    cerr << \"error: invalid width & height.\\n\";\n            }\n            else    /* line neither cir or rect, handle error */\n                cerr << \"error: unrecognized shape '\" << shape << \"'.\\n\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"\\nthe circles are:\\n\";     /* output valid circles */\n    for (auto& i : cir)\n        cout << \"  c: \" << i << \"\\n\";\n\n    cout << \"\\nthe triangles are:\\n\";   /* output valid triangles */\n    for (auto& i : tri)\n        cout << \"  t: \" << i << \"\\n\";\n\n    cout << \"\\nthe rectangles are:\\n\";  /* output valid rectangles */\n    for (auto& i : rect)\n        cout << \"  r: \" << i.width << \" x \" << i.height << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nBy storing values for your circles, triangles and rectangles independent of each other, you then have the ability to handle each type of shape as its own collection, e.g.\nExample Use/Output\n$ ./bin/read_shapes dat/shapes.txt\nerror: unrecognized shape '3'.\nerror: unrecognized shape '10'.\n\nthe circles are:\n  c: 12\n  c: 2\n  c: 2.4\n\nthe triangles are:\n  t: 2.9\n  t: 2.9\n\nthe rectangles are:\n  r: 3 x 4\n\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions.

{"text": "Q: how to store Image profile(jpg file) and PDF documents in AWS DynamoDB? I am migrating my Spring MVC services to the AWS API Gateway using Python Lambda with Dynamo Db , I have endpoint where i can store or retrieve the people image and also the reports which is PDF file , can you please suggest me which is the best practice to store the images and pdf files in AWS .\nYour help is really appreciated!!\n\nA: Keep in mind, DynamoDB has a 400KB limit on each item.\nI would recommend using S3 for images and PDF documents. It also allows you to set up a CDN much more easily, rather than using something like DynamoDB.\nYou can always link your S3 link to an item in DynamoDB if you need to store data related to the file.\n\nA: AWS DynamoDB has a limit on the row size to be max of 400KB. So, it is not advisable to store the binary content of image/PDF document in a column directly. Instead, you should store the image/PDF in S3 and have the link stored in a column in DynamoDB.\nIf you were using Java, you could have leveraged the S3Link abstraction that takes care of storing the content in S3 and maintaining the link in DynamoDB column.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47903547", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Is there another way to send HTTPS request using a certificate in Python?\n\nA: It sounds like you need something similar to an answer I have provided before to perform simple client certificate authentication. Here is the code for convenience modified slightly for your question:\nimport httplib\nimport urllib2\n\nPEM_FILE = '/path/certif.pem' # Renamed from PEM_FILE to avoid confusion\nCLIENT_CERT_FILE = '/path/clientcert.p12' # This is your client cert!\n\n# HTTPS Client Auth solution for urllib2, inspired by\n# http://bugs.python.org/issue3466\n# and improved by David Norton of Three Pillar Software. In this\n# implementation, we use properties passed in rather than static module\n# fields.\nclass HTTPSClientAuthHandler(urllib2.HTTPSHandler):\n    def __init__(self, key, cert):\n        urllib2.HTTPSHandler.__init__(self)\n        self.key = key\n        self.cert = cert\n    def https_open(self, req):\n        #Rather than pass in a reference to a connection class, we pass in\n        # a reference to a function which, for all intents and purposes,\n        # will behave as a constructor\n        return self.do_open(self.getConnection, req)\n    def getConnection(self, host):\n        return httplib.HTTPSConnection(host, key_file=self.key, cert_file=self.cert)\n\n\ncert_handler = HTTPSClientAuthHandler(PEM_FILE, CLIENT_CERT_FILE)\nopener = urllib2.build_opener(cert_handler)\nurllib2.install_opener(opener)\n\nf = urllib2.urlopen(\"https://10.10.10.10\")\nprint f.code\n\n\nA: See http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html\nhttplib.HTTPSConnection does not do any verification of the server\u2019s certificate.\nThe option to include your private certificate is when the server is doing certificate based authentication of clients. I.e. the server is checking the client has a certificate signed by a CA that it trusts and is allowed to access it's resources.\n\nIf you don't specify the cert optional argument, you should be able to connect to the HTTPS server, but not validate the server certificate.\n\nUpdate\nFollowing your comment that you've tried basic auth, it looks like the server still wants you to authenticate using basic auth. Either your credentials are invalid (have you independently verified them?) or your Authenticate header isn't formatted correctly. Modifying your example code to include a basic auth header and an empty post payload:\nimport httplib  \nconn = httplib.HTTPSConnection('10.10.10.10','443')   \nauth_header = 'Basic %s' % (\":\".join([\"myusername\",\"mypassword\"]).encode('Base64').strip('\\r\\n'))\nconn.request(\"POST\", \"/\",\"\",{'Authorization':auth_header}) \nresponse = conn.getresponse()       \nprint response.status, response.reason\nconn.close()\n\n\nA: What you're doing is trying to connect to a Web service that requires authentication based on client certificate.\nAre you sure you have a PEM file and not a PKCS#12 file?  A PEM file looks like this (yes, I know I included a private key...this is just a dummy that I generated for this example):\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----                                                                     \nMIICXQIBAAKBgQDDOKpQZexZtGMqb7F1OMwdcFpcQ/pqtCoOVCGIAUxT3uP0hOw8                                    \nCZNjLT2LoG4Tdl7Cl6t66SNzMVyUeFUrk5rkfnCJ+W9RIPkht3mv5A8yespeH27x                                    \nFjGVbyQ/3DvDOp9Hc2AOPbYDUMRmVa1amawxwqAFPBp9UZ3/vfU8nxwExwIDAQAB                                    \nAoGBAMCvt3svfr9zysViBTf8XYtZD/ctqYeUWEZYR9hj36CQyVLZuAnyMaWcS7j7                                    \nGmrfVNygs0LXxoO2Xvi0ZOxj/mZ6EcZd8n37LxTo0GcWvAE4JjPr7I4MR2OvGYa/                                    \n1696e82xwEnUdpyBv9z3ebleowQ1UWP88iq40oZYukUeignRAkEA9c7MABi5OJUq                                    \nhf9gwm/IBie63wHQbB2wVgB3UuCYEa4Zd5zcvJIKz7NfhsZKKcZJ6CBVxwUd84aQ                                    \nAue2DRwYQwJBAMtQ5yBA8howP2FDqcl9sovYR0jw7Etb9mwsRNzJwQRYYnqCC5yS                                    \nnOaNn8uHKzBcjvkNiSOEZFGKhKtSrlc9qy0CQQDfNMzMHac7uUAm85JynTyeUj9/                                    \nt88CDieMwNmZuXZ9P4HCuv86gMcueex5nt/DdVqxXYNmuL/M3lkxOiV3XBavAkAA                                    \nxow7KURDKU/0lQd+x0X5FpgfBRxBpVYpT3nrxbFAzP2DLh/RNxX2IzAq3JcjlhbN                                    \niGmvgv/G99pNtQEJQCj5AkAJcOvGM8+Qhg2xM0yXK0M79gxgPh2KEjppwhUmKEv9                                    \no9agBLWNU3EH9a6oOfsZZcapvUbWIw+OCx5MlxSFDamg                                                        \n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----                                                                    \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----                                                                         \nMIIDfjCCAuegAwIBAgIJAOYJ/e6lsjrUMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMIGHMQswCQYD                                    \nVQQGEwJVUzELMAkGA1UECBMCRkwxDjAMBgNVBAcTBVRhbXBhMRQwEgYDVQQKEwtG                                    \nb29iYXIgSW5jLjEQMA4GA1UECxMHTnV0IEh1dDEXMBUGA1UEAxMOd3d3LmZvb2Jh                                    \nci5jb20xGjAYBgkqhkiG9w0BCQEWC2Zvb0BiYXIuY29tMB4XDTExMDUwNTE0MDk0                                    \nN1oXDTEyMDUwNDE0MDk0N1owgYcxCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVTMQswCQYDVQQIEwJGTDEO                                    \nMAwGA1UEBxMFVGFtcGExFDASBgNVBAoTC0Zvb2JhciBJbmMuMRAwDgYDVQQLEwdO                                    \ndXQgSHV0MRcwFQYDVQQDEw53d3cuZm9vYmFyLmNvbTEaMBgGCSqGSIb3DQEJARYL                                    \nZm9vQGJhci5jb20wgZ8wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADgY0AMIGJAoGBAMM4qlBl7Fm0                                    \nYypvsXU4zB1wWlxD+mq0Kg5UIYgBTFPe4/SE7DwJk2MtPYugbhN2XsKXq3rpI3Mx                                    \nXJR4VSuTmuR+cIn5b1Eg+SG3ea/kDzJ6yl4fbvEWMZVvJD/cO8M6n0dzYA49tgNQ                                    \nxGZVrVqZrDHCoAU8Gn1Rnf+99TyfHATHAgMBAAGjge8wgewwHQYDVR0OBBYEFHZ+                                    \nCPLqn8jlT9Fmq7wy/kDSN8STMIG8BgNVHSMEgbQwgbGAFHZ+CPLqn8jlT9Fmq7wy                                    \n/kDSN8SToYGNpIGKMIGHMQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzELMAkGA1UECBMCRkwxDjAMBgNV                                    \nBAcTBVRhbXBhMRQwEgYDVQQKEwtGb29iYXIgSW5jLjEQMA4GA1UECxMHTnV0IEh1                                    \ndDEXMBUGA1UEAxMOd3d3LmZvb2Jhci5jb20xGjAYBgkqhkiG9w0BCQEWC2Zvb0Bi                                    \nYXIuY29tggkA5gn97qWyOtQwDAYDVR0TBAUwAwEB/zANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFAAOB                                    \ngQAv13ewjgrIsm3Yo8tyqTUHCr/lLekWcucClaDgcHlCAH+WU8+fGY8cyLrFFRdk                                    \n4U5sD+P313Adg4VDyoocTO6enA9Vf1Ar5XMZ3l6k5yARjZNIbGO50IZfC/iblIZD                                    \nUpR2T7J/ggfq830ACfpOQF/+7K+LgFLekJ5dIRuD1KKyFg==                                                    \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nRead this question.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5896380", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}
{"text": "Q: TFS configure variables on Release definition instantiation I have a release definition setup with several tasks. When a developer wants to create a release from this definition, i'd like to give them the option of selecting which features they'd like to release (turn on/off tasks). Ideally this would be via the Create Release dialog using a variable or similar.\nCan this be done? Or is the only way to achieve this to create a draft release and enable/disable the tasks on each environment? Believe this is prone to error (toggle task on one environment but forget to on another) and this is not an option as administrator has locked editing of definitions (prevent incorrect setup of production releases).\nUnderstand I can create separate release definitions to cover the options but it seems like a lot of duplication.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not supported in TFS currently. The workarounds are just like you mentioned above, to disable and enable those steps or use draft release.\nThis is a user voice about your request you could vote:\n https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-team-services/suggestions/19165690-select-steps-when-create-release\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777906", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Swift: How to not load AppDelegate during Tests I have an OS X application which on startup loads some data from a server and pushes notifications to the NSUserNotificationCenter.\nNow I have the problem that this also happens during my unit tests. I found no way yet to prevent this. Of course I could stub the HTTP loads. But in some cases I want to test the loading and then the notifications get sent anyway. \nWhat I'm trying to do is to make the test runs not load the AppDelegate but a fake one that I'm only using for tests. I found several examples [1] on how to do that with UIApplicationMain, where you can pass a specific AppDelegate class name. The same is not possible with NSApplicationMain [2].\nWhat I've tried is the following:\nRemoved @NSApplicationMain from AppDelegate.swift, then added a main.swift with the following content:\nclass FakeAppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {\n}\n\nNSApplication.sharedApplication()\nNSApp.delegate = FakeAppDelegate()\nNSApplicationMain(Process.argc, Process.unsafeArgv)\n\nThis code runs before tests but has no effect at all.\nI might have to say: My AppDelegate is almost empty. To handle the MainMenu.xib stuff I made a separate view controller which does the actual loading and notification stuff in awakeFromNib. \n[1] http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/prevent-unit-tests-from-loading-app-delegate-in-swift/\n[2] https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Miscellaneous/AppKit_Functions/#//apple_ref/c/func/NSApplicationMain\n\nA: Just an update on the previous accept answer, this is my main.swift:\nprivate func isTestRun() -> Bool {\n    return NSClassFromString(\"XCTestCase\") != nil\n}\n\nif isTestRun() {\n    // This skips setting up the app delegate\n    NSApplication.shared.run()\n} else {\n    // For some magical reason, the AppDelegate is setup when\n    // initialized this way\n    _ = NSApplicationMain(CommandLine.argc, CommandLine.unsafeArgv)\n}\n\nA bit more compact! I'm using Swift 4.1 and XCode 9.4.1\n\nA: After days of trying and failing I found an answer on the Apple forums:\n\nThe problem was that my main.swift file was initializing my AppDelegate before NSApplication had been initialized. The Apple documentation makes it clear that lots of other Cocoa classes rely on NSApplication to be up and running when they are initialized. Apparently, NSObject and NSWindow are two of them.\n\nSo my final and working code in main.swift looks like this:\nprivate func isTestRun() -> Bool {\n    return NSClassFromString(\"XCTest\") != nil\n}\n\nprivate func runApplication(\n    application: NSApplication = NSApplication.sharedApplication(),\n    delegate: NSObject.Type?   = nil,\n    bundle: NSBundle?          = nil,\n    nibName: String            = \"MainMenu\") {\n\n    var topLevelObjects: NSArray?\n\n    // Actual initialization of the delegate is deferred until here:\n    application.delegate = delegate?.init() as? NSApplicationDelegate\n\n    guard bundle != nil else {\n        application.run()\n        return\n    }\n\n    if bundle!.loadNibNamed(nibName, owner: application, topLevelObjects: &topLevelObjects ) {\n        application.run()\n    } else {\n        print(\"An error was encountered while starting the application.\")\n    }\n}\n\nif isTestRun() {\n    let mockDelegateClass = NSClassFromString(\"MockAppDelegate\") as? NSObject.Type\n    runApplication(delegate: mockDelegateClass)\n} else {\n    runApplication(delegate: AppDelegate.self, bundle: NSBundle.mainBundle())\n}\n\nSo the actual problem before was that the Nib was being loaded during tests. This solution prevents this. It just loads the application with a mocked application delegate whenever it detects a test run (By looking for the XCTest class).\nI'm sure I will have to tweak this a bit more. Especially when a start with UI Testing. But for the moment it works.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39116318", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}
{"text": "Q: How to use std::transform with a lambda function that takes additional parameters In C++ 11 (or higher) can I use std::transform and a lambda function to transform a vector that also takes other parameters?  For example, how do I pass param to the lambda function below?\nstd::vector<double> a{ 10.0, 11.0, 12.0 };\nstd::vector<double> b{ 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 };\nstd::vector<double> c;\ndouble param = 1.5;\n//The desired function is c = (a-b)/param   \ntransform(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), std::back_inserter(c),\n          [](double x1, double x2) {return(x1 - x2)/param; });\n\nstd::transform wants a function with two input parameters. Do I need to use std::bind?\n\nA: You just need to capture param in your capture list:\ntransform(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), std::back_inserter(c),\n          [param](double x1, double x2) {return(x1 - x2)/param; });\n\nCapturing it by reference also works - and would be correct if param was a big class. But for a double param is fine.\n\nA: This is what the lambda capture is for.  You need to specify & or = or param in the capture block ([]) of the lambda.  \nstd::vector<double> a{ 10.0, 11.0, 12.0 };\nstd::vector<double> b{ 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 };\nstd::vector<double> c;\ndouble param = 1.5;\n//The desired function is c = (a-b)/param   \ntransform(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), std::back_inserter(c),\n          [=](double x1, double x2) {return(x1 - x2)/param; });\n//         ^ capture all external variables used in the lambda by value\n\nIn the above code we just capture by value since copying a double and having a reference is pretty much the same thing performance wise and we don't need reference semantics.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53011875", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: How can I add an intranet-only endpoint to my IIS hosted WCF service? I have a WCF service hosted in IIS that uses basicHttpBindings. I'm adding a new method to the ServiceContract that will be called from a console app to perform an administrative task. I got to thinking, well wouldn't it be nice if I gave this method its own endpoint. Then I thought and what if that endpoint wasn't even publicly accessible. It would be much better if only a computer on our LAN could access it. It might even be cool if only an AD administrator was authorized to use it, but I don't want to get too elaborate. So I added a new ServiceContract interface that includes my new method. How can I restrict it to LAN access only? Do I need a NetTcpBinding? Networking is not my strong suit and I'm a little confused, conceptually, on how a TCP endpoint could be hosted from IIS. Additionally, when hosting multiple endpoints, does each have to have its own address or can they be at the same address?\n\nA: I am gonna answer some of your questions\n\n\n*\n\n*there is no binding that would limit access to LAN network though you can use windows authentication to allow users from your network to use the service \n\n*the nettcpbinding is only a tcp connection and you can host it on IIS pof course\ncheck this link for more information hosting nettcp on IIS\n\n*you can have one base address for multiple endpoints , example:\nhttps://localhost:8080/calculator.svc\nnet.tccp://localhost:8080/calculator.svc\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29483797", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Understanding hashCode(), equals() and toString() in Java I am beginner in Java and although I have a look at several questions and answers in SO, I am not sure if I completely understand the usage of hashCode(), equals() and toString() in Java. I encountered the following code in a project and want to understand the following issues:\n1. Is it meaningful to define these methods and call via super like return super.hashCode()?\n2. Where should we defines these three methods? For each entity? Or any other place in Java?\n3. Could you please explain me the philosophy of defining these 3 (or maybe similar ones that I have not seen  before) in Java?\n@Entity\n@SequenceGenerator(name = \"product_gen\", sequenceName = \"product_id_seq\")\n@Table\n@Getter\n@Setter\n@ToString(callSuper = true)\n@NoArgsConstructor\npublic class Product extends BaseEntity {\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = \"product_gen\")\n    private long id;\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return super.hashCode();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object other) {\n        return super.equals(other);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*toString() method returns the String representation of an Object. The default implementation of toString() for an object returns the HashCode value of the Object. We'll come to what HashCode is.\nOverriding the toString() is straightforward and helps us print the content of the Object. @ToString annotation from Lombok does that for us. It Prints the class name and each field in the class with its value.\nThe @ToString annotation also takes in configuration keys for various behaviours. Read here. callSuper just denotes that an extended class needs to call the toString() from its parent.\nhashCode() for an object returns an integer value, generated by a hashing algorithm. This can be used to identify whether two objects have similar Hash values which eventually help identifying whether two variables are pointing to the same instance of the Object. If two objects are equal from the .equals() method, they must share the same HashCode\n\n\n*They are supposed to be defined on the entity, if at all you need to override them.\n\n\n*Each of the three have their own purposes. equals() and hashCode() are majorly used to identify whether two objects are the same/equal. Whereas, toString() is used to Serialise the object to make it more readable in logs.\nFrom Effective Java:\n\nYou must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals().\nFailure to do so will result in a violation of the general contract\nfor Object.hashCode(), which will prevent your class from functioning\nproperly in conjunction with all hash-based collections, including\nHashMap, HashSet, and HashTable.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69024813", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: How to get name of windows service from inside the service itself I have a bunch of win services written in .NET that use same exact executable with different configs. All services write to the same log file. However since I use the same .exe the service doesn't know its own service name to put in the log file.\nIs there a way my service can programatically retrieve its own name?\n\nA: Insight can be gained by looking at how Microsoft does this for the SQL Server service. In the Services control panel, we see:\nService name: MSSQLServer\nPath to executable: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL.1\\MSSQL\\Binn\\sqlservr.exe\" -sMSSQLSERVER\nNotice that the name of the service is included as a command line argument. This is how it is made available to the service at run time. With some work, we can accomplish the same thing in .NET.\nBasic steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the installer take the service name as an installer parameter.\n\n*Make API calls to set the command line for the service to include the service name.\n\n*Modify the Main method to examine the command line and set the ServiceBase.ServiceName property. The Main method is typically in a file called Program.cs.\n\n\nInstall/uninstall commands\nTo install the service (can omit /Name to use DEFAULT_SERVICE_NAME):\ninstallutil.exe /Name=YourServiceName YourService.exe\n\nTo uninstall the service (/Name is never required since it is stored in the stateSaver):\ninstallutil.exe /u YourService.exe\n\nInstaller code sample:\nusing System;\nusing

{"text": "Q: How to wrap ConcurrentDictionary in BlockingCollection? I try to implement a ConcurrentDictionary by wrapping it in a BlockingCollection but did not seem to be successful.\nI understand that one variable declarations work with BlockingCollection such as ConcurrentBag<T>, ConcurrentQueue<T>, etc.\nSo, to create a ConcurrentBag wrapped in a BlockingCollection I would declare and instantiate like this:\nBlockingCollection<int> bag = new BlockingCollection<int>(new ConcurrentBag<int>());\n\nBut how to do it for ConcurrentDictionary? I need the blocking functionality of the BlockingCollection on both the producer and consumer side.\n\nA: Maybe you need a concurrent dictionary of blockingCollection\n        ConcurrentDictionary<int, BlockingCollection<string>> mailBoxes = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, BlockingCollection<string>>();\n        int maxBoxes = 5;\n\n        CancellationTokenSource cancelationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\n        CancellationToken cancelationToken = cancelationTokenSource.Token;\n\n        Random rnd = new Random();\n        // Producer\n        Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\n        {\n            while (true)\n            {\n                int index = rnd.Next(0, maxBoxes);\n                // put the letter in the mailbox 'index'\n                var box = mailBoxes.GetOrAdd(index, new BlockingCollection<string>());\n                box.Add(\"some message \" + index, cancelationToken);\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Produced a letter to put in box \" + index);\n\n                // Wait simulating a heavy production item.\n                Thread.Sleep(1000);\n            }\n        });\n\n        // Consumer 1\n        Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\n        {\n            while (true)\n            {\n                int index = rnd.Next(0, maxBoxes);\n                // get the letter in the mailbox 'index'\n                var box = mailBoxes.GetOrAdd(index, new BlockingCollection<string>());\n                var message = box.Take(cancelationToken);\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Consumed 1: \" + message);\n\n                // consume a item cost less than produce it:\n                Thread.Sleep(50);\n            }\n        });\n\n        // Consumer 2\n        Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\n        {\n            while (true)\n            {\n                int index = rnd.Next(0, maxBoxes);\n                // get the letter in the mailbox 'index'\n                var box = mailBoxes.GetOrAdd(index, new BlockingCollection<string>());\n                var message = box.Take(cancelationToken);\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Consumed 2: \" + message);\n\n                // consume a item cost less than produce it:\n                Thread.Sleep(50);\n            }\n        });\n\n        Console.ReadLine();\n        cancelationTokenSource.Cancel();\n\nBy this way, a consumer which is expecting something in the mailbox 5, will wait until the productor puts a letter in the mailbox 5. \n\nA: You'll need to write your own adapter class - something like:\npublic class ConcurrentDictionaryWrapper<TKey,TValue>\n    : IProducerConsumerCollection<KeyValuePair<TKey,TValue>>\n{\n    private ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary;\n\n    public IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> GetEnumerator()\n    {\n        return dictionary.GetEnumerator();\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()\n    {\n        return GetEnumerator();\n    }\n\n    public void CopyTo(Array array, int index)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public int Count\n    {\n        get { return dictionary.Count; }\n    }\n\n    public object SyncRoot\n    {\n        get { return this; }\n    }\n\n    public bool IsSynchronized\n    {\n        get { return true; }\n    }\n\n    public void CopyTo(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[] array, int index)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public bool TryAdd(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> item)\n    {\n        return dictionary.TryAdd(item.Key, item.Value);\n    }\n\n    public bool TryTake(out KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> item)\n    {\n        item = dictionary.FirstOrDefault();\n        TValue value;\n        return dictionary.TryRemove(item.Key, out value);\n    }\n\n    public KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[] ToArray()\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: Here is an implementation of a IProducerConsumerCollection<T> collection which is backed by a ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>. The T of the collection is of type KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>. It is very similar to Nick Jones's implementation, with some improvements:\npublic class ConcurrentDictionaryProducerConsumer<TKey, TValue>\n    : IProducerConsumerCollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>\n{\n    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> _dictionary;\n    private readonly ThreadLocal<IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>> _enumerator;\n\n    public ConcurrentDictionaryProducerConsumer(\n        IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer = default)\n    {\n        _dictionary = new(comparer);\n        _enumerator = new(() => _dictionary.GetEnumerator());\n    }\n\n    public bool TryAdd(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> entry)\n    {\n        if (!_dictionary.TryAdd(entry.Key, entry.Value))\n            throw new DuplicateKeyException();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public bool TryTake(out KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> entry)\n    {\n        // Get a cached enumerator that is used only by the current thread.\n        IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> enumerator = _enumerator.Value;\n        while (true)\n        {\n            enumerator.Reset();\n            if (!enumerator.MoveNext())\n                throw new InvalidOperationException();\n            entry = enumerator.Current;\n            if (!_dictionary.TryRemove(entry)) continue;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int Count => _dictionary.Count;\n    public bool IsSynchronized => false;\n    public object SyncRoot => throw new NotSupportedException();\n    public KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[] ToArray() => _dictionary.ToArray();\n    public IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> GetEnumerator()\n        => _dictionary.GetEnumerator();\n    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => GetEnumerator();\n    public void CopyTo(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[] array, int index)\n        => throw new NotSupportedException();\n    public void CopyTo(Array array, int index) => throw new NotSupportedException();\n}\n\npublic class DuplicateKeyException : InvalidOperationException { }\n\nUsage example:\nBlockingCollection<KeyValuePair<string, Item>> collection\n    = new(new ConcurrentDictionaryProducerConsumer<string, Item>());\n\n//...\n\ntry { collection.Add(KeyValuePair.Create(key, item)); }\ncatch (DuplicateKeyException) { Console.WriteLine($\"The {key} was rejected.\"); }\n\nThe collection.TryTake method removes a practically random key from the ConcurrentDictionary, which is unlikely to be a desirable behavior. Also the performance is not great, and the memory allocations are significant. For these reasons I don't recommend enthusiastically to use the above implementation. I would suggest instead to take a look at the ConcurrentQueueNoDuplicates<T> that I have posted here, which has a proper queue behavior.\nCaution: Calling collection.TryAdd(item); is not having the expected behavior of returning false if the key exists. Any attempt to add a duplicate key results invariably in a DuplicateKeyException.

{"text": "Q: Should a C++ temporary be constant? I have a C++ class that has the following interface:\nclass F {\npublic:\n    F(int n, int d);\n    // no other constructors/assignment constructors defined\n    F& operator *= (const F&);\n    F& operator *= (int);\n    int n() const;\n    int d() const;\n};\n\nAnd I have the following code:\nconst F a{3, 7};\nconst F b{5, 10};\nauto result = F{a} *= b; // How does this compile?\n\nUnder Visual Studio (VS) 2013, the commented line compiles without error. Under VS2015 , error C2678 is produced:\nerror C2678: binary '*=': no operator found \n    which takes a left-hand operand of type 'const F' \n    (or there is no acceptable conversion)\nnote: could be 'F &F::operator *=(const F &)'\nnote: or       'F &F::operator *=(int)'\nnote: while trying to match the argument list '(const F, const F)'\n\nMy expectation was that F{a} would create a non-const temporary copy of a to which operator *= (b) would be applied, after which the temporary object would be assigned to result. I did not expect the temporary to be a constant. Interestingly: auto result = F(a) *= b; compiles without error in VS2015, which I thought should be semantically the same.\nMy question is: which behaviour is correct VS2015 or VS2013 & why? \nMany thanks\n\nA: Visual Studio 2015 is not producing the correct result for:\nF{a}\n\nThe result should be a prvalue(gcc and clang both have this result) but it is producing an lvalue. I am using the following modified version of the OP's code to produce this result:\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass F {\npublic:\n    F(int n, int d) :n_(n), d_(d) {};\n    F(const F&) = default ;\n    F& operator *= (const F&){return *this; }\n    F& operator *= (int) { return *this; }\n    int n() const { return n_ ; }\n    int d() const { return d_ ; }\n    int n_, d_ ;\n};\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nstruct value_category {\n    static constexpr auto value = \"prvalue\";\n};\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nstruct value_category<T&> {\n    static constexpr auto value = \"lvalue\";\n};\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nstruct value_category<T&&> {\n    static constexpr auto value = \"xvalue\";\n};\n\n#define VALUE_CATEGORY(expr) value_category<decltype((expr))>::value\n\nint main()\n{\n  const F a{3, 7};\n  const F b{5, 10};   \n  std::cout << \"\\n\" <<  VALUE_CATEGORY( F{a} ) <<  \"\\n\";\n}\n\nHat tip to Luc Danton for the VALUE_CATEGORY() code.\nVisual Studio using webcompiler which has a relatively recent version produces:\nlvalue\n\nwhich must be const in this case to produce the error we are seeing. While both gcc and clang (see it live) produce:\nprvalue\n\nThis may be related to equally puzzling Visual Studio bug std::move of string literal - which compiler is correct?. \nNote we can get the same issue with gcc and clang using a const F:\nusing cF = const F ;\nauto result = cF{a} *= b; \n\nso not only is Visual Studio giving us the wrong value category but it also arbitrarily adding a cv-qualifier.\nAs Hans noted in his comments to your question using F(a) produces the expected results since it correctly produces a prvalue.\nThe relevant section of the draft C++ standard is section 5.2.3 [expr.type.conv] which says:\n\nSimilarly, a simple-type-specifier or typename-specifier followed by a braced-init-list creates a temporary\n  object of the specified type direct-list-initialized (8.5.4) with the specified braced-init-list, and its value is\n  that temporary object as a prvalue.\n\nNote, as far as I can tell this is not the \"old MSVC lvalue cast bug\". The solution to that issue is to use /Zc:rvalueCast which does not fix this issue. This issue also differs in the incorrect addition of a cv-qualifier which as far as I know does not happen with the previous issue.\n\nA: My thoughts it's a bug in VS2015, because if you specify user defined copy constructor:\nF(const F&);\n\nor make variable a non-const code will be compiled successfully.\nLooks like object's constness from a transferred into newly created object.\n\nA: Visual C++ has had a bug for some time where an identity cast doesn't produce a temporary, but refers to the original variable.\nBug report here: identity cast to non-reference type violates standard \n\nA: From http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision:\n\nUnder the following circumstances, the compilers are permitted to omit the \n  copy- and move-constructors of class objects even if copy/move constructor \n  and the destructor have observable side-effects.\n.......\nWhen a nameless temporary, not bound to any references, would be moved or \n  copied into an object of the same type (ignoring top-level cv-\nqualification), the copy/move is omitted. When that temporary is \n  constructed, it is constructed directly in the storage where it would \n  otherwise be moved or copied to. When the nameless temporary is the \n  argument of a return statement, this variant of copy elision is known as \n  RVO, \"return value optimization\".\n\nSo the compiler has the option to ignore the copy (which in this case would act as an implicit cast to non-const type).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34478737", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "15"}}

They are removed when the app is in the background and Android needs more memory some time later (might never happen).\n\nIs it safe to store the activity references in savedinstancestate\n\nYes this is what saved instance state was made for:\n\nAs your activity begins to stop, the system calls\n  onSaveInstanceState() so your activity can save state information with\n  a collection of key-value pairs. The default implementation of this\n  method saves information about the state of the activity's view\n  hierarchy, such as the text in an EditText widget or the scroll\n  position of a ListView.\n\n.\n\ncan i save all these instances?\n\nYou can't save the instances - you will have to store the information that you will use to re-build your activity as key-value pairs. What I do is I store just enough information so that the activity can rebuild itself. \nFor example, if the Activity has a list that was constructed from api.myapp.com, I will save this URL, as well as the scroll location of the list. The rest you should probably go retrieve again as if you had just launched the app for the first time - this will make your code much simpler.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24051963", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: UART DMA Tx/Rx Architecture \nPossible Duplicate:\nUART ISR Tx Rx Architecture \n\nI'm working with a TI micro right now that includes a DMA UART Driver and an operating system that supports parallel tasks. The UART driver's functions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*static void HalUARTInitDMA(void);\n\n*static void HalUARTOpenDMA(halUARTCfg_t *config);\n\n*static uint16 HalUARTReadDMA(uint8 *buf, uint16 len);\n\n*static uint16 HalUARTWriteDMA(uint8 *buf, uint16 len);\n\n*static void HalUARTPollDMA(void);\n\n*static uint16 HalUARTRxAvailDMA(void);\n\n*static void HalUARTSuspendDMA(void);\n\n*static void HalUARTResumeDMA(void);\n\n\nI'm trying to communicate with another peripheral that accepts messages terminated with a carriage return and responds with messages afterwards with a carriage return.\nI was curious what the best way to architect this type of communication state machine.  My problem is designing the callback function for the UART port such that it...\n\n\n*\n\n*does not hang the system waiting for a response. (Some sort of timeout)\n\n*If a response is read too soon, it will concat the responses together\n\n*A carriage return will signify the end of the message\n\n\nThe basic theory is something like this:\n//send messsage to peripheral\nHalUARTWriteDMA(\"tx\\r\",4);\n\n//wait a little bit for the device to process the message\n\n//start reading from the peripheral    \ndo {\n    //how many bytes are at the RX port?\n    int len = HalUARTRxAvailDMA();\n\n    //Read those bytes\n    HalUARTReadDMA(msg, len);\n\n    //append the rx msg to the buffer\n    strcat(rxbuf, msg)\n\n    //does the response contain a CR?\n} while(strchr(rxbuf, 0x0D));\n\nThere are a couple of obvious flaws with this idea. I was hoping someone could share some ideas on how this type of communication is performed?\nThanks!\n\nA: There is one immediate problem with the design as you describe it if you intend to block  the thread waiting for messages - which is the use variable sized messages and a CR as the delimiter.\nI imagine that HalUARTReadDMA() is designed to block the calling thread until len bytes have been received so you clearly cannot reliably use it to block for a variable length message.\nThe code would look something like (making a few assumptions):\nwhile (1) \n{\n    static const size_t bufferSize = sizeof(Message_t);\n    uint8_t buffer[bufferSize];\n\n    // blocks until message received \n    unsigned len = HalUARTReadDMA(buffer, bufferSize);\n\n    if (len == bufferSize)\n        processMessage(buffer);\n}\n\nThere's no particularly nice or reliable solution to the problem of using variable sized messages with DMA that doesn't involve polling - unless the DMA controller can detect end-of-message delimiters for you.\nIf you can't change the message format, you'd be better off with interrupt-driven IO in which you block on reception of individual message bytes - especially in the case of a UART, which has relatively low data rate. \n\nA: Unless your DMA driver has the functinality to accept a queue of buffer pointers, can generate an interrupt when a CR is received and move on its own to the next buffer pointer, you are going to be stuck with iterating the rx data, looking for a CR.\nIf you have to iterate the data, you may as well do it in a 'classic' ISR, fetching the chars one-by-one from the rx FIFO and shoving them into a buffer until a CR is received.  \nYou could then queue the buffer pointer into a suitable circular queue, fetch another buffer from another circular pool queue of 'empty' buffers for the next message, signal a semaphore so that the thread that is going to handle the message will be run and exit from your ISR via the OS so that an immediate reschedule is performed.\nThe rx thread could dequeue the message, process it and then requeue it to the pool queue for re-use by the ISR.\nContinually searching a complete buffer for a CR with strchr() is not likely to be particularly efficient or easy - the CR may be in the middle of the DMA buffer and you involve yourself with data copying of the remining partial buffer.\n.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13003971", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: video will not autoplay on chrome when it is inserted into the DOM I have a video (meant for background purposes), that is muted and I intend to auto-play.

The general solutions are either to be muted (which I already do), or to use dom manipulation to call play (which doesn't work). Is there a way to get this to work after inserting the video into the dom. The reason I care is because my actual website requires everything to be rendered (My site is in ember.js). \nThis is in Chrome version 71.\nThanks!\n\nA: This is probably a bug (and not the only one with this autoplay policy...).\nWhen you set the muted attribute through Element.setAttribute(), the policy is not unleashed like it should be.\nTo workaround that, set the IDL attribute through the Element's property:\nfunction render() {\n  const video = document.createElement('video');\n  video.muted = true;\n  video.autoplay = true;\n  video.loop = true;\n  video.setAttribute('playsinline', true);\n\n  const source = document.createElement('source');\n  source.setAttribute('src', 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dthskrjhy/video/upload/v1545324364/ASR/Typenex_Dandelion_Break_-_Fade_To_Black.mp4');\n\n  video.appendChild(source);\n  document.body.appendChild(video);\n}\nrender();\n\nAs a fiddle since StackSnippets requiring a click event form the parent page are anyway always allowed to autoplay ;-).\n\nA: Async, Await, & IIFE\nAfter finding this article a couple of months ago, I still couldn't get a consistent autoplay behavior, muted or otherwise. So the only thing I hadn't tried is packing the async function in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).\nIn the demo:\n\n*\n\n*It is dynamically inserted into the DOM with .insertAdjacentHTML()\n\n\n*It should autoplay\n\n\n*It should be unmuted\n\n\n*All of the above should happen without user interaction.\n\nDemo\n\n\nvar clip = document.getElementById('clip');\n\n(function() {\n  playMedia();\n})();\n\nasync function playMedia() {\n  try {\n    await stamp();\n    await clip.play();\n  } catch (err) {\n  }\n}\n\nfunction stamp() {\n  document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `<video id='clip' poster='https://image.ibb.co/iD44vf/e2517.jpg' src='https://storage04.dropshots.com/photos8000/photos/1381926/20181019/182332.mp4' width='100%' autoplay loop playsinline></video>`);\n}\n\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54246807", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

If, on the other hand, it's an instance variable used as a cache (to avoid calling getA() multiple times), you need to assign the result of getA() to a, in which case I'd use your second alternative, since it's shorter, and thus clearer (you can still use the ternary conditional operator with assignment - return a != null ? a : (a = getA()); - but I find that less clear).\n\nA: I prefer the second choice as there is only one return statement, and this can help debugging (you only need to put in one breakpoint rather than two). Also you're arguably duplicating code in the first choice.\nBut in this instance I'd prefer using the ternary conditional:\nreturn a == null ? getA() : a;\n\nA: I prefer the second option, The best practice is have only one return statement in a method. That will be the more readable code.\n\nA: The second is more concise, and could be better because of this, but this is a subjective matter and no-one can give you a particularly objective answer. Whatever you like or fits into your teams coding standards is the answer.\nAs has been pointed out, there is a shorter way to do this:\nreturn a!=null ? a : getA();\n\nbut again, it entirely depends on what you and your team prefer. Personally I prefer the second way you showed to this, as it is more readable (in my opinion).\n\nA: I'm assuming for a second that a is a class member and that getA() is a method that creates an instance of a.\nThe best solution should be to push this logic in the called method.  In other words, rather than have:\nvoid someFunction() {\n    // logic\n    if(a==null) {\n        a=getA();\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nA getA() {\n    // creation logic of instance A\n    return newAInstance;\n}\n\nYou should have:\nvoid someFunction() {\n    // logic\n\n    return getA();\n}\n\nA getA() {\n    if(a == null) {\n        // creation logic of instance A\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nThe cost of the method call is minimal and worth not having to deal with when a will be instantiated.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34988589", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}
{"text": "Q: Improving Winforms performance with large number of controls Are there any ways to improve performance when constructing several forms with large numbers of controls (500+)?\nOur controls are laid out in a label + 6 text box per row configuration, as shown below:\n\nWe have used the following containers to structure our controls:\n\n*\n\n*DevExpress' XtraLayoutControl\n\n*Panels around each row and moving manually\n\n*Common table control\n\nWe can't use a grid as the text boxes have to be hidden on a case-by-case basis and our forms have to look fairly close to the printouts. Also, each row has it's own data type, so we need to add validation and editors for each.\nThe table control is the most performant, where each form takes around 2 seconds to load.\nAs each of these will represent a document in our software and we allow users to open multiple documents at once, we are trying to find a way to improve the performance.\nOne suggestion was to cache the actual form and have a state object that stores the data. However, we allow the user to see more than one document at once.\nAnother suggestion was to load the document in parts and show each part as it becomes loaded. This isn't ideal as we are known for having a document that looks almost exactly like the printout.\nAre there any other strategies available, or should we just bight the bullet at tell our customers that this program will be slower than it's VB6 predecessor?\nAn example of the form design we're redeveloping is here: Link\n\nA: Complex datatype handling and stuff is to you, this is a 5 minute before-lunch sample to show how much winforms sucks and how much WPF rules:\nnamespace WpfApplication5\n{\n\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n    private List<Item> _items;\n    public List<Item> Items\n    {\n        get { return _items ??

A specific DataGridViewCell can be made read-only by setting the ReadOnly property to true. You could then use the DataGridView.CellFormatting event to hide the value of the read-only cells.

Since true is \"higher\" than false all which are not 0 come first. The ThenBy is for the internal ordering of the non-zero group.\nIf that's too abstract, maybe you find this more readable:\nint[] ordered = collection.OrderBy(i => i != 0 ? 0 : 1).ThenBy(i => i).ToArray();\n\n\nA: If you are not using data source for your grid, then you can use DataGridView.SortCompare event like this\nvoid yourDataGridView_SortCompare(object sender, DataGridViewSortCompareEventArgs e)\n{\n    if (e.Column.Name == \"Id\" && e.CellValue1 != null && e.CellValue2 != null)\n    {\n        var x = (int)e.CellValue1;\n        var y = (int)e.CellValue2;\n        e.SortResult = x == y ? 0 : x == 0 ? 1 : y == 0 ? -1 : x.CompareTo(y);\n        e.Handled = true;\n    }\n}\n\nDon't forget to attach the event handler to your grid view.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35200095", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

If you wanted to log the new state, you can do so in the callback:\nfunction toggleReport( table ) {\n    $( table ).toggle('fast', function(){\n        console.log( \"Element is visible? \" + $(this).is(\":visible\") );\n    });\n}\n\nNote, if you're passing in the ID of the element, your selector will need to be modified:\n$( \"#\" + table ).toggle();\n\n\nA: There's a prebuilt Jquery function for this.\n\nA: You can use toggle function to achieve this....\n$(selector).toggle();\n\n\nA: demo http://jsfiddle.net/uW3cN/2/\ndemo with parameter passed http://jsfiddle.net/uW3cN/3/\nGood read API toggle: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/\ncode\nfunction toggleReport(){\n//removed the argument\n$('#table_1').toggle();\n\n}\n\n\u200banother sample rest html is in here http://jsfiddle.net/uW3cN/3/\nfunction toggleReport(tableid){\n//removed the argument\n$('#'+tableid).toggle();\n\n}\n\n\u200b\n\nA: The mistake you made in your original function is that you did not actually use the parameter you passed into your function.You selected \"#table\" which is simply selecting a element on the page with the id \"table\". It didn't reference your variable at all.\nIf your intention was to pass an ID into the selector should be written, jQuery(\"#\" + table). If table is instead a reference to a DOM element, you would write jQuery(table) (no quotes and no pound sign). \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10748783", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: MS Excel Function: Get data from a cell of a particular column and the current row I just want to say up front that I have very little skill in Excel.\nActually, I never use it.\nWhat I have been trying to do is create a function that gets the value of a cell of a particular column and the current row.\n\nFor example, I want the value of cell:\nColumn: B\nRow: ROW()\n\nWhat I will ultimately use this to do is average cells in a row.\nIf there's a better way to do that, feel free to give suggestions, although it would still be neat to learn how to do this if it's possible. =)\nI apologize if I messed up in presenting or posting my question; aside from Excel, I'm also new to stackoverflow.\n\nA: To get the content of cell (B,ROW()) do:\n= INDIRECT(CONCATENATE(\"B\", ROW()))\n\nIf you just want to calculate the average of a given line of numbers (e.g. first 10 cells in row 2):\n= AVERAGE(A2:J2)\n\nThe ':' represents an area from the upper left corner (A2) to the lower right (J2).\nAs mentioned by @MattClarke, you can use =AVERAGE(ROW_NUMBER:ROW_NUMBER) to calculate the average of a whole row (in this case row ROW_NUMBER) where you don't know the exact number of data fields. Pay attention not to use this formula in that exact row (row ROW_NUMBER) to avoid a circular reference. (Thanks @MattClarke for the hint!)\n\nA: Getting the average across a fixed range of cells is pretty easy: just use a formula like =average(A4:H4) where the parameter specifies the first and last cell. If you want the average of a whole row and you don't know how many columns of data there are, then you can use something like =average(8:8), where the number 8 is the row number of the data to be averaged.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20109567", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: how to defuse this binary bomb phase 4 I am having trouble this piece of code in assembly language.\nEssentially I have to input 2 numbers that matches 2 numbers the code is comparing with. \nOn line 0x08048c47 in phase_4, it compares the first input with 2, so I know the first input has to be 2. It then moves 4 spaces from the first input to next input, which then gets 2 subtracted from it. Now the (input-2) is compared with 2. It will continue the instruction if the inputs are below than or equal to 2. I've tested this with numbers 2,3,4 which pass the comparison. Other numbers greater than 4 and less than 2 do not pass the comparison and will cause the bomb to explode.\nI'm stuck on this part because the value being returned from func4 is not the same was the value represented at  0x08048c6e in phase_4, which is 8(%esp).

{"text": "Q: How can you make a function that returns a function in ocaml for an example, if a function receives a function as a factor and iterates it twice\nfunc x = f(f(x))\nI have totally no idea of how the code should be written\n\nA: You just pass the function as a value. E.g.:\nlet apply_twice f x = f (f x)\n\nshould do what you expect. We can try it out by testing on the command line:\nutop # apply_twice ((+) 1) 100\n- : int = 102\n\nThe (+) 1 term is the function that adds one to a number (you could also write it as (fun x -> 1 + x)). Also remember that a function in OCaml does not need to be evaluated with all its parameters. If you evaluate apply_twice only with the function you receive a new function that can be evaluated on a number:\nutop # let add_two = apply_twice ((+) 1) ;;\nval add_two : int -> int = <fun>\nutop # add_two 1000;;\n- : int = 1002\n\n\nA: To provide a better understanding: In OCaml, functions are first-class\nvalues. Just like int is a value, 'a -> 'a -> 'a is a value (I\nsuppose you are familiar with function signatures). So, how do you\nimplement a function that returns a function? Well, let's rephrase it:\nAs functions = values in OCaml, we could phrase your question in three\ndifferent forms:\n[1] a function that returns a function\n[2] a function that returns a value\n[3] a value that returns a value\nNote that those are all equivalent; I just changed terms.\n[2] is probably the most intuitive one for you.\nFirst, let's look at how OCaml evaluates functions (concrete example):\nlet sum x y = x + y\n(val sum: int -> int -> int = <fun>)\n\nf takes in two int's and returns an int (Intuitively speaking, a\nfunctional value is a value, that can evaluate further if you provide\nvalues). This is the reason you can do stuff like this:\nlet partial_sum = sum 2\n(int -> int = <fun>)\n\n\nlet total_sum = partial_sum 3 (equivalent to: let total_sum y = 3 + y)\n(int = 5)\n\npartial_sum is a function, that takes in only one int and returns\nanother int. So we already provided one argument of the function,\nnow one is still missing, so it's still a functional value. If that is\nstill not clear, look into it more. (Hint: f x = x is equivalent to\nf = fun x -> x) Let's come back to your question. The simplest\nfunction, that returns a function is the function itself:\nlet f x = x \n(val f:'a -> 'a = <fun>)\nf \n('a -> 'a = <fun>)\n\nlet f x = x Calling f without arguments returns f itself.  Say you\nwanted to concatenate two functions, so f o g, or f(g(x)):\nlet g x = (* do something *)\n(val g: 'a -> 'b)\nlet f x = (* do something *)\n(val f: 'a -> 'b)\nlet f_g f g x = f (g x)\n(val f_g: ('a -> 'b) -> ('c -> 'a) -> 'c -> 'b = <fun>)\n\n('a -> 'b): that's f, ('c -> 'a): that's g, c: that's x.\nExercise: Think about why the particular signatures have to be like that.  Because let f_g f g x = f (g x) is equivalent to let f_g = fun f -> fun g -> fun x -> f (g x), and we do not provide\nthe argument x, we have created a function concatenation. Play around\nwith providing partial arguments, look at the signature, and there\nwill be nothing magical about functions returning functions;  or:\nfunctions returning values.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71513663", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Why do we need gulp over karma? I am new to gulp and karma tool.I have searched google and worked on small testcases and executed successfully. \nIn karma we are configuring the unit testcases js files that are to be tested and run using the command 'start karma karma.conf.js'\nIn gulp we are configuring the karma config file and execute using the command 'gulp test'\nwhat benefits we are getting while running a gulp test over karma directly?\n\nA: One advantage of using gulp is that you can then orchestrate more complicated tasks based on that task. For example, you might want a gulp task that first builds the project then executes the unit tests. You could then execute that with one command rather than two commands.\nHowever if you're only running the gulp task that runs karma then there won't be any advantage in using gulp (other than the command being easier to type).\nYou can look at the Gulp Recipes page to see other tasks you can accomplish with gulp.\n\nA: The only thing I can really think of is getting gulp to source all the appropriate 3rd party JS files required to run the tests using something like wiredep. For example\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n    Server = require('karma').Server,\n    bowerDeps = require('wiredep')({\n        dependencies: true,\n        devDependencies: true\n    }),\n    testFiles = bowerDeps.js.concat([\n        'src/**/*.js',\n        'test/**/*.js'\n    ]);\n\ngulp.task('test', function(done) {\n    new Server({\n        configFile: 'karma.conf.js',\n        files: testFiles,\n        singleRun: true\n    }, function(exitStatus) {\n        if (exitStatus) {\n            console.warn('Karma exited with status', exitStatus);\n        }\n        done();\n    }).start();\n});\n\nOtherwise, you have to maintain the files array in your karma.conf.js file manually.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34033971", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: How to express the type for a constant? I have to write some functions with a significant amount of constant in it in a relatively small amount of lines.\n( Don't bother about the way I wrote the formula, it's there to simply express the fact that I have a lot of constants in a small package, this specific example is small too, in practice I have a minimum of 6-7 constants for each function )\nT foo( T x )\n{\n  return k1 * k2 * x - k3;\n}\n\nAssuming that I'm not interested in declaring the constants as static ( it will also cause problems with the naming convention in my specific case ) const T k1 = 42; , I would like to find an alternative .\nA viable alternative can be\nT foo( T x )\n{\n  return uint32_t{42} * uint32_t{21} * x - uint32_t{33};\n}\n\nAt this point there are 2 main problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not sure if this kind of declaration will create an entire object or just \"a number\"\n\n*it's a C++ only solution and I'm writing really simple functions that should be C99+ compatible .\n\n\nWhy I would like to do this ?\nIt's simple, the values for this constants are highly variable, really small values or big values, with really small values there is a significant amount of space wasted, plus this constants are math constants so they will never change and I can optimize this section right from the first release.\nThere is also another aspect, the default type for numeric constants is a signed integer, I would like to go for an unsigned integer type of arbitrary size.\nThe problem with the static declaration const T k1 = 42; outside the functions, is that different constants have the same name, the value of the constant is different because the function is different, but the name of the constant, mathematically speaking, is the same, so with this solution I'll end up having multiple declarations of the same variable in the same scope. That's why I can't use names or this kind of declarations .\nDo you have any idea for writing this in a way that is compatible with both C++ and C ?\n\nA: In C, for integers, you add 'U', 'L', or 'LL' to numbers to make them unsigned, long, or long long in a few combinations\na = -1LL;  // long long\nb = -1U;   // unsigned\nc = -1ULL; // unsigned long long\nd = -1LLU; // unsigned long long\ne = -1LU;  // unsigned long\nf = -1UL;  // unsigned long\n\nOne other option, in C, is to cast. The compiler, very probably, will do the right thing :)\nreturn (uint32)42 - (int64)10;\n\nBut probably the best option, as pointed by ouah in the comments below, is to use Macros for integer constants (C99 Standard 7.18.4)\na = UINT32_C(-1); // -1 of type uint_least32_t\nb = INT64_C(42);  // 42 of type int_least64_t\n\n\nA: Is there something wrong this?\ninline T foo(T x)\n{\n    int k1 = 42;\n    int k2 = 21;\n    int k3 = 33;\n\n    return 1ull * x * k1 * k2 - k3;\n}\n\nYour comments on the other answer suggest you are unsure about which types to use for the constants.\nI don't see what the problem is with just using any type in which that constant is representable.\nFor the calculation expression, you would need to think about the size and signed-ness of intermediate calculations. In this example I start with 1ull to use unsigned arithmetic mod 2^64. If you actually wanted arithmetic mod 2^32 then use 1ul instead, and so on.\nCan you elaborate on what you meant by \"space wasted\"? It sounds as if you think there is some problem with using 64-bit ints. What sort of \"space\" are you talking about?\nAlso, to clarify, the reason you don't want to declare k1 global is because k1 has a different value in one function than it does in another function?   (As opposed to it having the same value but you think it should have a different data type for some reason).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23660950", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

Ill also attach a transript of my original assignment, which may be less confusing and helpful to you if you're trying to help me:\n/*\nThe calendar we use today is the Gregorian Calendar, devised by Italian astronomer Aloysius Lilius and decreed by Pope Gregory XIII on February 24th, 1582. In the Gregorian Calendar, the average length of a year is exactly 365.2425 days. We can make that happen with some rather complex \"leap year\" rules:\nIf a year is divisible by 4, it's a leap year\u2026 unless it's divisible by 100, in which case it's not a leap year\u2026 unless it's divisible by 400, in which case it's a leap year.\nOkay, that's confusing. Let's try again:\nA year is a leap year if:\na. It's divisible by 400\nb. It's divisible by 4 and it's not divisible by 100.\nBased on those rules, 1512, 1600, and 2000 were leap years. 1514, 1700, and 1900 were not.\n(And you thought leap year was just every four years! That was the case with Julius Caesar's calendar\u2014which was wrong, because adding a 366th day every four years would give us an average year length of 365.25 days instead of the far more accurate 365.2425 days. 0.0075 days per year doesn't sound like a lot, but in the 1500s astronomers noticed that predictable events, such as the solstice and equinox, were \"off\" by about 10 days. Hence the new, improved calendar.)\nIn the Gregorian Calendar, the number of days per month are as follows:\nMonth              Name               Days\n1                      January             31\n2                      February           28 or 29\n3                      March               31\n4                      April                 30\n5                      May                  31\n6                      June                 30\n7                      July                  31\n8                      August              31\n9                      September        30\n10                     October            31\n11                     November         30\n12                     December         31\nBased on the Gregorian Calendar's leap year rules, and the usual number of days per month, complete the class FunWithCalendars. You will need:\nThree int field variables to keep track of the month, day, and year.\nThe constructor of FunWithCalendars, which will take in values for the month, day, and year, and assign them to field variables. (This is written for you, you may use the starter file FunWithCalendars.java ).\nThe method:\nboolean isValid()\nwhich will return a true or false. A true result means that the month and day are valid values for that year.\nYou will need three helper methods:\nboolean isLeapYear()\nwhich will return a true only if the year represents a leap year.\nYou also need:\nboolean isValidMonth()\nwhich will return a true only if the month field is between 1 and 12. And finally:\nboolean isValidDay()\nwhich will return a true only if that day exists in that month in the given year. Remember to check for a leap year when checking to see if 29 is valid in February!\nAgain, we expect a true from isValid() if and only if we get a true from isValidMonth() and from isValidDay(). (We will assume that all years are valid.)\nTests:\n7/20/2010 is valid.\n13/1/2009 is not valid. (13 is not a valid month.)\n11/31/2009 is not valid. (That day does not exist in that month.)\n2/29/2007 is not valid. (2007 was not a leap year.)\n2/29/2000 is valid. (2000 was a leap year.)\n*/\nThanks to anyone who can help!\n\nA: Let\u2019s take the first test as an example:\n\nTests:\n7/20/2010 is valid.\n\nSo in your driver class/test class construct a FunWithCalendars object denoting July 20 2010. The constructor takes three arguments for this purpose. Next call its isValid method. I believe that the idea was that you shouldn\u2019t need to pass the same arguments again. Your isValid method takes two boolean arguments. Instead I believe that it should take no arguments and itself call the two helper methods passing the values that are already inside the FunWithCalendars object. So before you can get your driver class to work, I believe you have to fix your design on this point.\nOnce you get the call to isValid() to work, store the return value into a variable. Compare it to the expected value (true in this case). If they are equal, print a statement that the test passed. If they are not equal, print a statement containing both the expected and the observed value.\nDo similarly for the other tests. Don\u2019t copy-paste the code, though. Instead wrap it in a method and call the method for each test case, passing as arguments the data needed for that particular test. Remember to include the expected result as an argument so the method can compare.\nEdit:\n\n\u2026 My confusion is in how to construct an object (in general, and also\nspecifically FunWithCalendars), how to call the isValid method and\nhave it not take any arguments, how to have the isValid method call\nthe two helper methods which pass the values that are in the\nFunWIthCalendars object.\n\nIt\u2019s basic stuff, and I don\u2019t think Stack Overflow is a good place to teach basic stuff. Let\u2019s give it a try, only please set your expectations low.\nHow to construct an object: You\u2019re already doing this in your driver class using the new operator:\n    FunWithCalendars test = new FunWithCalendars () ;\n\nOnly you need to pass the correct arguments to the constructor. Your constructor takes three int arguments, so it needs to be something like:\n    FunWithCalendars test = new FunWithCalendars(7, 20, 2020);\n\nHow to call the isValid method and have it take no arguments, after the above line:\n    boolean calculatedValidity = test.isValid();\n\nThis stores the value returned from isValid() (false or true) into a newly created boolean variable that I have named calculatedValidity. From there we may check whether it has the expected value, act depending on it and/or print it. The simplest thing is to print it, for example:\n    System.out.println(\"Is 7/20/2020 valid? \" + calculatedValidity);\n\nCalling with no arguments requires that the method hasn\u2019t got any parameters:\npublic boolean isValid () \n{ \n\nHow to have isValid() call the two helper methods: You may simple write the method calls en lieu of mentioning the parameters that were there before. Again remember to pass the right arguments:\n    if (isValidMonth(month) && isValidDay(month, day, year, isLeapYear(year)) ) \n\nIn the method calls here I am using the instance variables (fields) of the FunWithCalendars object as arguments. This causes the method to use the numbers that we entered through the constructor and to use the three helper methods.\nI have run your code with the above changes. My print statement printed the expected:\n\nIs 7/20/2020 valid? true\n\n\nPS I am on purpose not saying anything about possible bugs in your code. It\u2019s a lot better for you to have your tests tell you whether there are any.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64423047", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Working with images in C++ or C The first thing is that I am a beginner.  Okay?\nI've read related answers and questions, but please help me with this problem:\nHow can I open an JPEG image file in C++, convert it to a grayscale image, get its histogram, resize it to a smaller image, crop a particular area of it, or show a particular area of it?\nFor these tasks, is C or C++ faster in general?\nWhat libraries are simplest and fastest?  The running time is very important.\nThanks.\n\nA: There are many good libraries for working with images in C and C++, none of which is clearly superior to all others.  OpenCVwiki, project page has great support for some of these tasks, while ImageMagickwiki, project page is good at others.  The JPEG group has its own implementation of JPEG processing functions as well.  These are probably good resources to start from; the API documentation can guide you more specifically on how to use each of these.\nAs for whether C or C++ libraries are bound to be faster, there's no clear winner between the two.  After all, you can always compile a C library in C++.  That said, C++ libraries tend to be a bit trickier to pick up because of the language complexity, but much easier to use once you've gotten a good feel for the language.  (I am a bit biased toward C++, so be sure to consider the source).  I'd recommend going with whatever language you find easier for the task; neither is a bad choice here, especially if performance is important.\nBest of luck with your project!\n\nA: well for basic image manipulations you could also try Qt's QImage class (and other). This gives you basic functionality for opening, scaling, resizing, cropping, pixel manipulations and other tasks.\nOtherwise you could as already said use ImageMagick or OpenCV. OpenCV provides a lot of examples with it for many image manipulation/image recognition tasks...\nHope it helps...\n\nA: here is an example using magick library.\nprogram which reads an image, crops it, and writes it to a new file (the exception handling is optional but strongly recommended):\n#include <Magick++.h>\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nusing namespace Magick;\nint main(int argc,char **argv)\n{\n  // Construct the image object. Seperating image construction from the\n  // the read operation ensures that a failure to read the image file\n  // doesn't render the image object useless.\n  Image image;\n\n  try {\n    // Read a file into image object\n    image.read( \"girl.jpeg\" );\n\n    // Crop the image to specified size (width, height, xOffset, yOffset)\n    image.crop( Geometry(100,100, 100, 100) );\n\n    // Write the image to a file\n    image.write( \"x.jpeg\" );\n  }\n  catch( Exception &error_ )\n    {\n      cout << \"Caught exception: \" << error_.what() << endl;\n      return 1;\n    }\n  return 0;\n}\n\ncheck many more examples here\n\nA: libgd is about the easiest, lightest-weight solution.\ngdImageCreateFromJpeg\ngdImageCopyMergeGray\ngdImageCopyResized\n\nOh, and it's all C.\n\nA: If running time is really important thing then you must consider image processing library which offloads processing job to GPU chip, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Core Image (Osx)\n\n*OpenVIDIA (Windows)\n\n*GpuCV (Windows, Linux)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4906736", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

The pumping lemma says we can write this as w = uvx such that |uv| <= p, |v| < 0 and for all natural numbers n, u(v^n)x is also a string in the language. Because |uv| <= p, the substring uv of w consists entirely of instances of the symbol a. Pumping up or down by choosing a value for n other than one guarantees that the number of a's in the resulting string will change, while the number of b's stays the same.

{"text": "Q: Declaring constants with the nameof() the constant as the value Scenario\nI have a class for declaring string constants used around a program:\npublic static class StringConstants\n{\n    public const string ConstantA = \"ConstantA\";\n    public const string ConstantB = \"ConstantB\";\n    // ...\n}\n\nEssentially, it doesn't matter what the actual value of the constant is, as it used when assigning and consuming. It is just for checking against.\nThe constant names will be fairly self-explanatory, but I want to try and avoid using the same string values more than once.\n\nWhat I would like to do\nI know that nameof() is evaluated at compile-time, so it is entirely possible to assign the const string's value to the nameof() a member.\nIn order to save writing these magic strings out, I have thought about using the nameof() the constant itself.\nLike so:\npublic static class StringConstants\n{\n    public const string ConstantA = nameof(ConstantA);\n    public const string ConstantB = nameof(ConstantB);\n    // ...\n}\n\n\nQuestion...\nI guess there is no real benefit of using the nameof(), other than for refactoring?\nAre there any implications to using nameof() when assigning constants?\nShould I stick to just using a hard-coded string?\n\nA: Whilst I think the use of nameof is clever, I can think of a few scenarios where it might cause you a problem (not all of these might apply to you):\n1/ There are some string values for which you can't have the name and value the same. Any string value starting with a number for example can't be used as a name of a constant. So you will have exceptions where you can't use nameof.\n2/ Depending how these values are used (for example if they are names of values stored in a database, in an xml file, etc), then you aren't at liberty to change the values - which is fine until you come to refactor. If you want to rename a constant to make it more readable (or correct the previous developer's spelling mistake) then you can't change it if you are using nameof.\n3/ For other developers who have to maintain your code, consider which is more readable:\npublic const string ConstantA = nameof(ContantA);\n\nor\npublic const string ConstantA = \"ConstantA\";\n\nPersonally I think it is the latter. In my opinion if you go the nameof route then that might give other developers cause to stop and wonder why you did it that way. It is also implying that it is the name of the constant that is important, whereas if your usage scenario is anything like mine then it is the value that is important and the name is for convenience.\nIf you accept that there are times when you couldn't use nameof, then is there any real benefit in using it at all? I don't see any disadvantages aside from the above. Personally I would advocate sticking to traditional hard coded string constants.\nThat all said, if your objective is to simply to ensure that you are not using the same string value more than once, then (because this will give you a compiler error if two names are the same) this would be a very effective solution. \n\nA: I think nameof() has 2 advantages over a literal strings:\n1.) When the name changes, you will get compiler errors unless you change all occurences. So this is less error-prone.\n2.) When quickly trying to understand code you didn't write yourself, you can clearly distinguish which context the name comes from. Example:\nViewModel1.PropertyChanged += OnPropertyChanged; // add the event handler in line 50\n\n...\n\nvoid OnPropertyChanged(object sender, string propertyName) // event handler in line 600\n{\n    if (propertyName == nameof(ViewModel1.Color))\n    {\n         // no need to scroll up to line 50 in order to see\n         // that we're dealing with ViewModel1's properties\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: Using the nameof() operator with public constant strings is risky. As its name suggests, the value of a public constant should really be constant/permanent. If you have public constant declared with the nameof() and if you rename it later then you may break your client code using the constant. In his book Essential C# 4.0, Mark Michaelis points out: (Emphasis is mine)\n\npublic constants should be permanent because changing their value will\nnot necessarily take effect in the assemblies that use it. If an\nassembly references constants from a different assembly, the value of\nthe constant is compiled directly into the referencing assembly.\nTherefore, if the value in the referenced assembly is changed but the\nreferencing assembly is not recompiled, then the referencing assembly\nwill still use the original value, not the new value. Values that\ncould potentially change in the future should be specified as readonly\ninstead.\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40888699", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10"}}

I don't know why it isn't more to the point.\nNote that the class you want to materialize must have been mapped, or: it must be in the dbml. I say this because your ITIPO class is not partial, which makes me wonder how you can make it implement an interface (well, maybe you just slimmed down the code).\nSide note: don't use all capitals for class names, and prefix an interface specification with \"I\", not a class.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13911036", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

I will change this once I accomplish a successful run. Also, I know that my stored procedure works because I have executed it in Sql Server Management Studio successfully.

I try to draw a graph, and call setNeedsDisplay each time new data is added to the graph.\nThe graph receives new data via addData:(NSNotification*)theNote, which then tries several ways to call setNeedsDisplay to redraw the view.  The data does not get redrawn properly, however, at this time.  If I drag the window to another screen, or if I click on the graph and call setNeedsDisplay from mouseDown then the view is redrawn correctly.

{"text": "Q: redux differentiation with context api My understanding is that React's Context API was essentially introduced for quick and dirty global state management, particularly before Redux Toolkit was introduced to simplify the overhead of implementing Redux.\nMy understanding is that one of the main downsides of Context API is that it any update to any property on it will re-render all component fields which are bound to Context API (full re-render).\nI recently explained that downside to someone and he asked why that wouldn't be the case with Redux.  He said Redux uses the Context API under the covers which appears to be the case based on some googling:\nhttps://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/accessing-store#:~:text=Internally%2C%20React%20Redux%20uses%20React's,object%20instance%20generated%20by%20React.\nA few questions:\n1 - Can you confirm that Context API does a full component re-render when any state value is changed on it?\n2 - Can you confirm that Redux uses Context API under the covers?  And can you confirm if Redux Toolkit still uses Context API under the covers?\n3 - I was under the impression that Context API was introduced to be a simpler alternative to tools like Redux.  But if Redux uses Context API then did Context API come first but maybe it wasn't exposed directly to the developer?\n4 - If Redux does use Context API under the covers then can you provide any insight into how Redux avoids a full component re-render?  I would assume that there's somevtype of mapping layer but I'd be interested to get some more insight into the specific implementation details\n\nA: \nMy understanding is that React's Context API was essentially introduced for quick and dirty global state management\n\nThat's a common misunderstanding. Context is not a state management system, any more than props is a state management system. Context (like props) is a way to get data from one component to another. The difference is that props always passes the data to direct children, while context makes the data available to whichever random components in a subtree are interested.\n\nMy understanding is that one of the main downsides of Context API is that it any update to any property on it will re-render all component fields which are bound to Context API (full re-render).\n\nThis is true. Similarly, if you change props, the component that receives those props must rerender\n\n1 - Can you confirm that Context API does a full component re-render when any state value is changed on it?\n\nOf the specific components that are listening to that context, yes.\n\n2 - Can you confirm that Redux uses Context API under the covers? And can you confirm if Redux Toolkit still uses Context API under the covers?\n\nReact-redux does use context, yes. Pure redux and redux toolkit don't, since they're general purpose libraries not directly related to react, but I think you meant react-redux.\nThat <Provider store={store}> that you must render at the top of a react-redux app is there to provide a context to the components underneath it. Components that call hooks like useSelector or useDispatch then use the context to find the store that they should interact with.\n\n3 - I was under the impression that Context API was introduced to be a simpler alternative to tools like Redux. But if Redux uses Context API then did Context API come first but maybe it wasn't exposed directly to the developer?\n\nContext has existed for a long time, but it used to be an unofficial feature. They've also made it easier to use over time.\n\n4 - If Redux does use Context API under the covers then can you provide any insight into how Redux avoids a full component re-render?\n\nThe context is only providing a minimal amount of things to the child components, most importantly the store object. The reference to the store object does not typically change, so since the context value does not change, the child components do not need to render. To see exactly what it's providing, see this code: https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/src/components/Provider.tsx#L33\nThe contents of the store does change, but that's not what the context is providing. To get the contents of the store, the individual components subscribe to the store, using redux's store.subscribe, plus a special hook called useSyncExternalStore. Basically, redux fires an event when the store's state is updated, and then the individual components set their own local state if it's a change they care about. This local state change is what causes the rerender.\n\nIf you're writing code that uses context, you're rarely going to be doing things fancy enough to require useSyncExternalStore or a custom subscription system. So the main things you'll want to keep in mind are:\n\n*\n\n*Keep the context focused on a single task. For example, if you have a theme object to control your app's colors, and also a user object which describes who is currently logged in, put these in different contexts. That way a component that just cares about the theme doesn't need to rerender when the user changes, and vice versa.\n\n\n*If your context value is an object, memoize it so it's not changing on every render (see this documentation)\n\nA: I'm a Redux maintainer.  @NicholasTower gave a great answer, but to give some more details:\nContext and Redux are very different tools that solve different problems, with some overlap.\nContext is not a \"state management\" tool. It's a Dependency Injection mechanism, whose only purpose is to make a single value accessible to a nested tree of React components.  It's up to you to decide what that value is, and how it's created.  Typically, that's done using data from React component state, ie, useState and useReducer.  So, you're actually doing all the \"state management\" yourself - Context just gives you a way to pass it down the tree.\nRedux is a library and a pattern for separating your state update logic from the rest of your app, and making it easy to trace when/where/why/how your state has changed.  It also gives your whole app the ability to access any piece of state in any component.\nIn addition, there are some distinct differences between how Context and (React-)Redux pass along updates.  Context has some major perf limitations - in particular, any component that consumes a context will be forced to re-render, even if it only cares about part of the context value.\nContext is a great tool by itself, and I use it frequently in my own apps.  But, Context doesn't \"replace Redux\".  Sure, you can use both of them to pass data down, but they're not the same thing.   It's like asking \"Can I replace a hammer with a screwdriver?\". No, they're different tools, and you use them to solve different problems.\nBecause this is such a common question, I wrote an extensive post detailing the differences:\nWhy React Context is Not a \"State Management\" Tool (and Why It Doesn't Replace Redux)\nTo answer your questions specifically:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, updating a Context value forces all components consuming that context to re-render... but there's actually a good chance that they would be re-rendering anyway because React renders recursively by default, and setting state in a parent component causes all components inside of that parent to re-render unless you specifically try to avoid it.  See my post A (Mostly) Complete Guide to React Rendering Behavior, which explains how all this works.\n\n*Yes, React-Redux does use Context internally... but only to pass down the Redux store instance, and not the current state value.  This leads to very different update characteristics.  Redux Toolkit, on the other hand, is just about the Redux logic and not related to any UI framework specifically.\n\n*Context was not introduced to be an alternative to Redux.  There was a \"legacy Context\" API that existed in React well before Redux itself was created, and React-Redux used that up through v5.  However, that legacy context API was broken in some key ways.  The current React Context API was introduced in React 16.3 to fix the problems in legacy Context, not specifically to replace Redux.\n\n*React-Redux uses store subscriptions and selectors in each component instance, which is a completely different mechanism than how Context operates.\n\nI'd definitely suggest reading the posts I linked above, as well as these other related posts:\n\n*\n\n*Redux - Not Dead Yet!\n\n*When (and when not) to Reach for Redux\n\n*React, Redux, and Context Behavior.\n\n\nA: Original blog post by Mark Erikson:\nI'll just copy paste some info, but here's the original source and I recommend going directly here: https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/01/blogged-answers-react-redux-and-context-behavior/\nMore links here:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links\n\n*https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/\n\n*https://medium.com/async/how-useselector-can-trigger-an-update-only-when-we-want-it-to-a8d92306f559\nAn explanation of how React Context behaves, and how React-Redux uses Context internally\nThere's a couple assumptions that I've seen pop up repeatedly:\n\n*\n\n*React-Redux is \"just a wrapper around React context\"\n\n*You can avoid re-renders caused by React context if you destructure the context value\n\nBoth of these assumptions are incorrect, and I want to clarify how they actually work so that you can avoid mis-using them in the future.\nFor context behavior, say we have this initial setup:\nfunction ProviderComponent() {\n    const [contextValue, setContextValue] = useState({a: 1, b: 2});\n\n    return (\n        <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>\n            <SomeLargeComponentTree />\n        </MyContext.Provider>\n    )\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent() {\n    const {a} = useContext(MyContext);\n    return <div>{a}</div>\n}\n\nIf the ProviderComponent were to then call setContextValue({a: 1, b: 3}), the ChildComponent would re-render, even though it only cares about the a field based on destructuring. It also doesn't matter how many levels of hooks are wrapping that useContext(MyContext) call. A new reference was passed into the provider, so all consumers will re-render. In fact, if I were to explicitly re-render with <MyContext.Provider value={{a: 1, b: 2}}>, ChildComponent would still re-render because a new object reference has been passed into the provider! (Note that this is why you should never pass object literals directly into context providers, but rather either keep the data in state or memoize the creation of the context value.)\nFor React-Redux: yes, it uses context internally, but only to pass the Redux store instance down to child components - it doesn't pass the store state using context!. If you look at the actual implementation, it's roughly this but with more complexity:\nfunction useSelector(selector) {\n    const [, forceRender] = useReducer( counter => counter + 1, 0);\n    const {store} = useContext(ReactReduxContext);\n        \n    const selectedValueRef = useRef(selector(store.getState()));\n\n    useLayoutEffect(() => {\n        const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {\n            const storeState = store.getState();\n            const latestSelectedValue = selector(storeState);\n\n            if(latestSelectedValue !== selectedValueRef.current) {\n                 selectedValueRef.current = latestSelectedValue;\n                 forceRender();\n            }\n        })\n        \n        return unsubscribe;\n    }, [store])\n\n    return selectedValueRef.current;\n}\n\nSo, React-Redux only uses context to pass the store itself down, and then uses store.subscribe() to be notified when the store state has changed. This results in very different performance behavior than using context to pass data.\nThere was an extensive discussion of context behavior in React issue #14110: Provide more ways to bail out of hooks. In that thread, Sebastian Markbage specifically said:\n\nMy personal summary is that new context is ready to be used for low frequency unlikely updates (like locale/theme). It's also good to use it in the same way as old context was used. I.e. for static values and then propagate updates through subscriptions. It's not ready to be used as a replacement for all Flux-like state propagation.\n\nIn fact, we did try to pass the store state in context in React-Redux v6, and it turned out to be insufficiently performant for our needs, which is why we had to rewrite the internal implementation to use direct subscriptions again in React-Redux v7.\nFor complete detail on how React-Redux actually works, read my post The History and Implementation of React-Redux, which covers the changes to the internal implementation over time, and how we actually use context.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75498437", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: Using Reflection to determine which Fields are backing fields of a Property I'm using reflection to map out objects. These objects are in managed code but I have no visibility into their source code, underlying structure, etc. other than through reflection. The overarching goal of all this is a rudimentary memory map of an object (similar in functionality to SOS.dll DumpObject and !ObjSize commands). As such, I'm trying to determine which members are being \"double counted\" as both a field and a property. \nFor example:\npublic class CalendarEntry\n{\n    // private property \n    private DateTime date { get; set;}\n\n    // public field \n    public string day = \"DAY\";\n}\n\nWhen mapped shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fields\n\n*\n\n*day\n\n*k__BackingField\n\n\n*Properties\n\n*\n\n*date\n\n\n\nWhere as a class like this:\npublic class CalendarEntry\n{\n    // private field \n    private DateTime date;\n\n    // public field \n    public string day = \"DAY\";\n\n    // Public property exposes date field safely. \n    public DateTime Date\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return date;\n        }\n        set\n        {\n                date = value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen mapped shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fields\n\n*\n\n*day\n\n*date\n\n\n*Properties\n\n*\n\n*Date\n\n\n\nAt first glance there's nothing to tell you that the Date property's \"backing field\" is the field named date. I'm trying to avoid counting date twice in this scenario since that will give me a bad memory size approximation. \nWhat's more confusing/complicated is I've come across scenarios where properties don't always have a corresponding field that will be listed through the Type.GetFields() method so I can't just ignore all properties completely.\nAny ideas on how to determine if a field in the collection returned from Type.GetFields() is essentially the backing field of some corresponding property returned from Type.GetProperties()?\nEdit- I've had trouble determining what conditions a property will not have a corresponding field in listed in the collection returned from Type.GetFields(). Is anyone familiar with such conditions?\nEdit 2- I found a good example of when a property's backing field would not be included in the collection returned from Type.GetFields(). When looking under the hood of a String you have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Object contains Property named FirstChar\n\n*Object contains Property named Chars\n\n*Object contains Property named Length\n\n*Object contains Field named m_stringLength\n\n*Object contains Field named m_firstChar\n\n*Object contains Field named Empty\n\n*Object contains Field named TrimHead\n\n*Object contains Field named TrimTail\n\n*Object contains Field named TrimBoth\n\n*Object contains Field named charPtrAlignConst\n\n*Object contains Field named alignConst\n\n\nThe m_firstChar and m_stringLength are the backing fields of the Properties FirstChar and Length but the actual contents of the string are held in the Chars property. This is an indexed property that can be indexed to return all the chars in the String but I can't find a corresponding field that holds the characters of a string. Any thoughts on why that is? Or how to get the backing field of the indexed property?\n\nA: The name of a property's backing field is a compiler implementation detail and can always change in the future, even if you figure out the pattern.\nI think you've already hit on the answer to your question: ignore all properties.\nRemember that a property is just one or two functions in disguise.  A property will only have a compiler generated backing field when specifically requested by the source code.  For example, in C#:\npublic string Foo { get; set; }\n\nBut the creator of a class need not use compiler generated properties like this.  For example, a property might get a constant value, multiple properties might get/set different portions of a bit field, and so on.  In these cases, you wouldn't expect to see a single backing field for each property.  It's fine to ignore these properties.  Your code won't miss any actual data.\n\nA: You can ignore all properties completely. If a property doesn't have a backing field, then it simply doesn't consume any memory.\nAlso, unless you're willing to (try to) parse CIL, you won't be able to get such mapping. Consider this code:\nprivate DateTime today;\n\npublic DateTime CurrentDay\n{\n    get { return today; }\n}\n\nHow do you expect to figure out that there is some relation between the today field and the CurrentDay property?\nEDIT: Regarding your more recent questions:\nIf you have property that contains code like return 2.6;, then the value is not held anywhere, that constant is embedded directly in the code.\nRegarding string: string is handled by CLR in a special way. If you try to decompile its indexer, you'll notice that it's implemented by the CLR. For these few special types (string, array, int, \u2026), you can't find their size by looking at their fields. For all other types, you can.\n\nA: To answer your other question:Under what circumstances do properties not have backing fields? \npublic DateTime CurrentDay\n{\n    get { return DateTime.Now; }\n}\n\nor property may use any other number of backing fields/classes\npublic string FullName \n{\n    get {return firstName + \" \" + lastName;}\n}\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14322660", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "13"}}

Is there a way to do a pseudo-process.exit mid-flight and abort processing the request, so I don't waste time on other stuff? For example how can I stop at the above // explode lines and not process anything else? throw doesn't leap over scope boundaries. Basically, I think, I want to return or break out of the createServer callback from within a nested callback. Is the only way to do this to be able to have code with a single path and just not have more than one statement at each step? Like, horizontal coding, instead of vertical KLOCs.\nI'm a Node noob obviously.\nEdit: Maybe another way to ask the question is: Is it possible to abort at the // explode C line, not read any more data, not process the end event, and not process any more lines in the doMoreSomethings callback (if there were any)? I'm guessing the latter isn't possible, because as far as I know, doMoreSomethings runs to completion, including attaching the data and end event handlers, and only then will the next event in the queue (probably a data event) get processed, at which point doMoreSomethings is done. But I am probably missing something. Does this code just zip through, call isIt and isItReally, assign the event handlers, hop out of all the callbacks, the createServer callback finishes, and then all the extra stuff (data/end/etc.) runs from the event queue?\n\nA: Typically you will use a return statement. When you call return any code below it will not get executed. Although, if your functions isIt() or isItReally() are asynchronous functions then you will be running into trouble as those are used in a synchronous fashion.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40808578", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Callback parameters gets shifted I have a video c++ callback function where the parameters get suddently shifted after a few hours.

However, nHeight is 320 (the width value) and nFrameErrorNo is 240 (the nHeight value).\nHow can the parameters get shift that way?\n\nA: The shift could be caused by the hidden this pointer. http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/8-8-the-hidden-this-pointer/\nFrom the code you have pasted here\nvoid CCameraInstance::VideoCallback(void *pContext, unsigned char *pBuffer, long nWidth, long nHeight, long nFrameErrorNo)\n\nI can see the callback function is a member of class CCameraInstance\nI'm not sure whether you are defining the function as a static function or a normal one. But in theory it should be a static function to avoid the this pointer. Using a C++ class member function as a C callback function\nHowever, I had a problem with C++/CLI even if i have define the member function as static. The this pointer/Handle still exist.\nI think you can try to define your function as \nvoid CCameraInstance::VideoCallback(CCameraInstance* test,void *pContext, unsigned char *pBuffer, long nWidth, long nHeight, long nFrameErrorNo)\n\nand have try.\nIf you are using C++/CLI it would be \nvoid CCameraInstance::VideoCallback(CCameraInstance^ test,void *pContext, unsigned char *pBuffer, long nWidth, long nHeight, long nFrameErrorNo)\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19498545", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: Composite/Combined Indexing vs Single Index vs multiple Combined Indexed on a large table I have a very large table (that is still growing) (around 90GB with ~350mil rows). It is a table that include sales of items, if you were wondering.\nIn this table, there's (for example), column A,B,C,D,E,F,G.\nCurrently, I am using a combined index, consisting of (A,B,C,D,E,F).\nUsually, the query will consist of A,B,C,D,E. F is included occasionally (hence the indexing).\neg,\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE A = ? AND B = ? AND  C = ? AND  D = ? AND  E = ?;\nSometimes, with the addon of AND F = ?;\nBut on certain occasion, the query will consist of A,B,C,D,G (whereby G is not indexed (not combined nor single indexed).\nThis causes timeout on certain occasion as the data is quite big.\nSo my question is, in order to solve this issue in terms of indexing,\nshould I\nOption 1: add G into the combined index, making it become (A,B,C,D,E,F,G).\n\n*\n\n*Does this even work when I query A,B,C,D,G (missing E & F)?\n\nOption 2: add G as a single index.\n\n*\n\n*Based on what i know, this does not work, as my query has A,B,C,D,G. The first combined index will be used instead (correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nOption 3: Go with option 1, combine all the columns, but I change my query instead, to always query A,B,C,D,E,F,G even when F is not needed.\neg,\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE A = ? AND B = ? AND  C = ? AND  D = ? AND  E = ? AND F IS NOT NULL AND G = ?;\nThanks\n\nA: Option 1 - Yes, this will work. The server will perform index seek by (A,B,C,D,E) and furter index scan by (G).\nOption 2 - Makes no sense in most cases, server uses only one index for one source table copy. But when the selectivity of single index by (G) is higher than one for (A,B,C,D,E) combination then the server will use this single-column index.\nOption 3 - The processing is equal to one in Option 2.\n\nA: Are the PRIMARY KEY's column(s) included in A..E ?  If so, none of the indexes are needed.\nWhat datatypes are involved?\nAre they all really tests on =?  If not then 'all bets are off'.  More specifically, useful indexes necessarily start with the columns tested with = (in any order).  In particular, F IS NOT NULL is not = (but IS NULL would count as =).\nI would expect INDEX(A,B,C,D,E, anything else or nothing else) to work for all of the queries you listed.  (Hence, I suspect there are some details missing from your over-simplified description.)\nHow \"selective\" are F and G?

This morning, after fixing some other bugs, The penny finally dropped - all I was missing was a single line of code right before closing the thickbox's form: \nApplication.DoEvents();\n\nThe annoying thing is that it's not something that's new to me, I've used it many times before including in the main application and in the thickbox code itself...

{"text": "Q: Updating parent component only after multiple child components have completed running I have a Parent react component with multiple child components that are created through a .map() function. I am passing in a function addCallback() as child props so I have a reference and can trigger all child's handleRun() function via the Parent.\nI'm trying to update state of my Parent component to running = true when all children are running and to running = false and render said status on the parent when all children have completed running. However the state doesn't seem to update in the particular sequence I specify.\nHere is how I'm doing it:\nlet promise1 = this.setState({isRunning:  true},\n            () => {\n                this.state.childRef.map(x => x())\n            });\n\nPromise.all([promise1])\n    .then(() => this.setState({isRunning: false}))\n\nHere's the entire code in codesandbox: link \nWould appreciate your help as I'm still pretty new to React (and Javascript in general). Thanks!\n\nA: Cause runSomething is not a Promise. You must change. \nrunSomething() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    this.setState({ status: \"running\" });\n     // simulate running something that takes 8s\n     setTimeout(() => {\n       this.setState({ status: \"idle\" });\n       resolve(true);\n     }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\nA working sandbox here https://codesandbox.io/s/fragrant-cloud-5o2um\n\nA: Using async in a function declaration automatically returns a Promise wrapped around whatever you are returning from your function. In your case, it's undefined. This is why your current code is not throwing any errors at the moment.\nYou will need a mechanism to wait for the setTimeout. Changing the runSomething function like this will work\n  async runSomething() {\n    this.setState({ status: \"running\" });\n\n    // simulate running something that takes 8s\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        this.setState({ status: \"idle\" }, resolve);\n      }, 3000);\n    });\n  }\n\nDo notice the line this.setState({ status: \"idle\" }, resolve);. It makes sure that your promise resolves not only after the setTimeout but also after the child's state is changed to \"idle\". Which is the correct indication that your child component has moved to \"idle\" state.\nCodesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-boyd-12hkj\n\nA: Here is the sandbox implementation of what you are trying to achieve. Sanbox\nHere i have created a state in parent component that will be updated when child is running. \nthis.state = {\n  callbacks: [],\n  components: [\n    {\n      index: 0, // we don't need this field its just for your info you can just create [true,false] array and index will represent component index.\n      status: false\n    },\n    {\n      index: 1,\n      status: false\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nWhen all the status in component array is true we update the idle status of parent to running. \n  getAllRunningStatus() {\n    let { components } = this.state;\n    let checkAllRunning = components.map(element => element.status);\n    if (checkAllRunning.indexOf(false) === -1) { // you can also use !includes(false) \n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\ninside your render function \n<h1>Parent {this.getAllRunningStatus() ? \"running\" : \"idle\"}</h1>\n\nNote:- I have just written a rough code.

{"text": "Q: How to access a variable that was available when an async method was called? The animal names are fetched from an API that could return 404 if the animal is not found. But in order to properly log the error, we need to have access to the animal's country. Is it possible? I've read something from a guy called Stephen Cleary that made me think it is possible with lambdas, but I couldn't find anything.\nvar gettingNames = new List<Task<string>>();\n\nforeach (var animal in animals)\n{\n    gettingNames.Add(this.zooApi.GetNameAsync(animal));\n}\n\ntry\n{\n    await Task.WhenAll(gettingNames);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    var exception = gettingNames.Where(task => task.IsFaulted)\n        .SelectMany(x => x.Exception.InnerExceptions).First();\n\n    this.logger.LogError(\"The animal name from {Country} was not found\",\n        animal.Country); // This is the goal\n}\n\n\nA: One way to solve this problem is to project each Animal to a Task that contains more information than either a naked name or a naked error. For example you could project it to a Task<ValueTuple<Animal, string, Exception>> that contains three pieces of information: the animal, the animal's scientific name from the zooApi, and the error that may have happened while invoking the zooApi.GetScientificNameAsync method.\nThe easiest way to do this projection is the LINQ Select operator:\nList<Task<(Animal, string, Exception)>> tasks = animals.Select(async animal =>\n{\n    try\n    {\n        return (animal, await this.zooApi.GetScientificNameAsync(animal),\n            (Exception)null);\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        return (animal, null, ex);\n    }\n}).ToList();\n\n(Animal, string, Exception)[] results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);\n\nforeach (var (animal, scientificName, error) in results)\n{\n    if (error != null)\n        this.logger.LogError(error,\n            $\"The {animal.Name} from {animal.Country} was not found\");\n}\n\n\nA: You have almost nailed it. :)\nRather than having a List<Task<string>> you need a Dictionary<Task<string>, string> structure:\nstatic async Task Main()\n{\n    var taskInputMapping = new Dictionary<Task<string>, string>();\n    var inputs = new[] { \"input\", \"fault\", \"error\", \"test\"};\n    foreach (var input in inputs)\n    {\n        taskInputMapping.Add(DelayEcho(input), input);\n    }\n\n    try\n    {\n        await Task.WhenAll(taskInputMapping.Keys);\n    }\n    catch\n    {\n        foreach (var pair in taskInputMapping.Where(t => t.Key.IsFaulted))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"{pair.Value}: {pair.Key.Exception?.GetType().Name}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstatic readonly ImmutableArray<string> wrongInputs = \n    ImmutableArray.Create(\"error\", \"fault\");\nstatic async Task<string> DelayEcho(string input)\n{\n    if (wrongInputs.Contains(input)) throw new ArgumentException();\n    await Task.Delay(10);\n    return input;\n}\n\n\n*\n\n*taskInputMapping.Add(DelayEcho(input), input): Stores the input next to the Task itself\n\n*taskInputMapping.Where(t => t.Key.IsFaulted): Iterates through the faulted tasks\n\n*$\"{pair.Value}: {pair.Key.Exception?.GetType().Name}\": Retrieves the input + the related error\n\n\nA: I combined the answers and came up with this:\nvar tasks = animals.Select(async animal =>\n{\n    try\n    {\n        return await this.zooApi.GetNameAsync(animal);\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        this.logger.LogError(error,\n            $\"The {animal.Name} from {animal.Country} was not found\");\n\n        return null;\n    }\n});\n\nvar results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);\n\nforeach (var name in results.Where(x => x != null))...\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69383186", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

But I still don't believe this really answers your question. ASP.NET MVC allows you to render partial views within a webpage through `RenderPartial() but you didn't mention anything about using this.\nYou can find more at http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/mvc-2/how-do-i/how-do-i-work-with-data-in-aspnet-mvc-partial-views \n\nA: If you want to divide a single webpage into multiple hmtl files you can do it by inserting frames. This is an old way of programming and you don't really see it these days but its efficient at doing what you are asking. \n\nA: Yes, this is highly recommended. You are trying to apply the DRY principle (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself). It's an excellent idea to apply this to your HTML. You can achieve this using require, require_once, include, and include_once in PHP. If you want to get a bit fancier, take a look at templating systems like Smarty (see: http://www.smarty.net/)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17914717", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Managing users in the TFS work items \"Assigned To\" field So I know there have been a couple of posts around about this topic, but I don't think they've quite got to the bottom of it!\nSo my problem is that when I create a new work item in TFS, the users which I can assign it to include NT Authority\\Local Service (which is also the TFS service account). I'm not asking why, as I know that this field, by default is populated by the Valid Users group, and upon inspecting the groups, I can see that the group permissions hierarchy looks like this:\n -> Valid Users\n   -> Project Collection Admistrators\n      -> Project Collection Service Accounts\n         -> NT Authority\\Local Service\n\nAnd you can't change anything in the project collection service accounts, so surely by default, everyone has this user in the assign to field? So does this mean everyone accepts it, or do they modify their process templates to filter it out (see the blog here)?\nJust seems a bit odd to me that by default is isn't filtered out already! Clearly I don't want to be removing this from any permissions either (even if I could) as I'm worried it'll cause problems later.\nSo is filtering in the process template the only way (which looks like a bit of effort to maintain), or is there a simpler way?\n\nA: Under TFS2008, you do need to do it this way.  Under 2010, there might be an \"exclude\", but I'm not able to check that at the moment.\nTo keep from having a whole lot of maintenance, instead of listing each user individually, what we did was just pared down the list from \"Valid Users\" to the \"Moderators\" and \"Contributors\".

You might need to add using System.Linq; at the top.      \nfloat floatTester = 0;\nList<float[]> result = File.ReadLines(@\"Data.txt\")\n        .Where(l => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(l))\n        .Select(l => new {Line = l, Fields = l.Split(new[] { ',' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) })\n        .Select(x => x.Fields\n                      .Where(f => Single.TryParse(f, out floatTester))\n                      .Select(f => floatTester).ToArray())\n        .ToList();\n\n// now get your totals\nint numberOfLinesWithData = result.Count;\nint numberOfAllFloats = result.Sum(fa => fa.Length);\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*File.ReadLines reads the lines of a file (not all at once but straming)\n\n*Where returns only elements for which the given predicate is true(f.e. the line must contain more than empty text)\n\n*new { creates an anonymous type with the given properties(f.e. the fields separated by comma)\n\n*Then i try to parse each field to float\n\n*All that can be parsed will be added to an float[] with ToArray()\n\n*All together will be added to a List<float[]> with ToList()\n\nA: Found an efficient way to do this.

}\n}\n\n\n}\n\nthe class works fine for the vertical scroll, but there is an instability with the horizontal scroll. if you also have a better solution than the class i created kindly share.\n\nA: The best way to achieve your UI/UX requirement is to use TabLayout with a vertical recycler view.\nBoth list items in the recycler view and tabs in the tab layout can be set up as a dynamic number of items/tabs\nWhen you scroll up and down and reach the respective category, update the tab layout using the following code. You can identify each category from the\nTabLayout tabLayout = (TabLayout) findViewById(R.id.tabs); // Once for the Activity of Fragment\nTabLayout.Tab tab = tabLayout.getTabAt(someIndex); // Some index should be obtain from the dataset \ntab.select();\n\nIn the same way, when clicking on a tab or scrolling the tab layout, Update the RecyclerVew accordingly./\nrecyclerView.smoothScrollToPosition(itemCount)\n\nHope this will help, Cheers!!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74567007", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

Also set the mapreduce.job.jvm.numtasks to -1 to reuse the JVM.\nThe above settings will enable all the map tasks to run in single JVM sequentially. Now, SomeClass has to be made a singleton class.\nThis is not a best practice as the node is not efficiently utilized because of the lower number of map tasks that can run in parallel.

{"text": "Q: using Socket.io with React and Redux to handle a hundred of updates per second I have a list of items which are objects of data from the server (about 1000) that I need to sort, filter, put into Redux and connect to a React table component.  I'm using socket.io to listen for updates which sends these individual data objects that then need to be calculated into the table.  they can be an update, new one or, removing existing one.\nSo my question is what's the best way to manage so many incoming socket data events?  should i just throttle them before i update them into my redux state?  i dont want to constantly update my redux state or my table component will re-render too much.\nmy other option is i can request a current up to date list of all the \"active\" data and just ignore the update events.  so perhaps every few seconds just update the entire table with all the latest data instead of trying to manage hundreds of updates a second.\n\nA: I would stick to using REST api calls, but faking the update on the start of a redux's action, doing nothing except maybe adding a proper id to your object on success, and reverting back the state on failure only.\nYour reducer would kinda look like this in case of a create item action :\nexport default (state = {}, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ActionsTypes.CREATE_START:\n      // make the temporary changes\n\n    case ActionsTypes.CREATE_SUCCESS:\n      // update the previous temporary id with a proper id\n\n    case ActionsTypes.CREATE_FAILURE:\n      // delete the temporary changes\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nAnd your actions like this :\nconst ActionLoading = item => ({\n  type: ActionsTypes.CREATE_START,\n  item,\n});\n\nconst ActionSuccess = item => ({\n  type: ActionsTypes.CREATE_SUCCESS,\n  item ,\n  createdItem,\n});\n\nconst ActionFailure = item => ({\n  type: ActionsTypes.CREATE_FAILURE,\n  item,\n});\n\nexport default todo => (dispatch) => {\n  dispatch(ActionLoading(item)); // add the item to your state\n\n  const updatedTodo = await TodoClient.create(todo)\n\n  if (updatedTodo) {\n    dispatch(ActionSuccess(item, createdItem)) // update the temp item with a real id\n  } else {\n    dispatch(ActionFailure(item)) // remove the temporary item \n  }\n};\n\nIt is mandatory that you give temporary ids to the data you are managing for performace's sake and to let react key properly the items rendered in maps. I personally use lodash's uniqueId.\nYou'll have also to implement this behavior for updates and removals but it's basically the same: \n\n\n*\n\n*store the changes, update your object without waiting for the api and\nrevert the changes on failure.\n\n*remove your object without waiting for the api and pop it back on failure.\n\n\nThis will give a real time feel as everything will be updated instantly and only reverted on unmanaged errors. If you trust your backend enough, this is the way to go.    \nEDIT : Just saw your update, you can stick to this way of mutating the data (or to the normal way of updating the state on success) but to avoid too much complexity and rendering time, make sure you store your data using keyBy. Once your items are stored as an array of object keyed by their id, you will be able to add, remove and modify them with a O(1) complexity. Also, react will understand that it doesn't need to re-render the whole list but only the single updated item.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50999907", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Unable to perform successful Paypal webhook validation I am working to validate Paypal webhook data but I'm running into an issue where it's always returning a FAILURE for the validation status. I'm wondering if it's because this is all happening in a sandbox environment and Paypal doesn't allow verification for sandbox webhook events? I followed this API doc to implement the call: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/webhooks/v1/#verify-webhook-signature\nRelevant code (from separate elixir modules):\ndef call(conn, _opts) do\n  conn\n    |> extract_webhook_signature(conn.params)\n    |> webhook_signature_valid?()\n    |> # handle the result\nend\n\ndefp extract_webhook_signature(conn, params) do\n  %{\n    auth_algo: get_req_header(conn, \"paypal-auth-algo\") |> Enum.at(0, \"\"),\n    cert_url: get_req_header(conn, \"paypal-cert-url\") |> Enum.at(0, \"\"),\n    transmission_id: get_req_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-id\") |> Enum.at(0, \"\"),\n    transmission_sig: get_req_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-sig\") |> Enum.at(0, \"\"),\n    transmission_time: get_req_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-time\") |> Enum.at(0, \"\"),\n    webhook_id: get_webhook_id(),\n    webhook_event: params\n  }\nend\n\ndef webhook_signature_valid?(signature) do\n  body = Jason.encode!(signature)\n  case Request.post(\"/v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature\", body) do\n    {:ok, %{verification_status: \"SUCCESS\"}} -> true\n    _ -> false\n  end\nend\n\nI get back a 200 from Paypal, which means that Paypal got my request and was able to properly parse it and run it though its validation, but it's always returning a FAILURE for the validation status, meaning that the authenticity of the request couldn't be verified. I looked at the data I was posting to their endpoint and it all looks correct, but for some reason it isn't validating. I put the JSON that I posted to the API (from extract_webhook_signature) into a Pastebin here cause it's pretty large: https://pastebin.com/SYBT7muv\nIf anyone has experience with this and knows why it could be failing, I'd love to hear. \n\nA: I solved my own problem. Paypal does not canonicalize their webhook validation requests. When you receive the POST from Paypal, do NOT parse the request body before you go to send it back to them in the verification call. If your webhook_event is any different (even if the fields are in a different order), the event will be considered invalid and you will receive back a FAILURE. You must read the raw POST body and post that exact data back to Paypal in your webhook_event.\nExample:\nif you receive {\"a\":1,\"b\":2} and you post back {..., \"webhook_event\":{\"b\":2,\"a\":1}, ...} (notice the difference in order of the json fields from what we recieved and what we posted back) you will recieve a FAILURE. Your post needs to be {..., \"webhook_event\":{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}, ...}\n\nA: For those who are struggling with this, I'd like to give you my solution which includes the accepted answer.\nBefore you start, make sure to store the raw_body in your conn, as described in Verifying the webhook - the client side\n\n  @verification_url \"https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature\"\n  @auth_token_url \"https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token\"\n\n defp get_auth_token do\n    headers = [\n      Accept: \"application/json\",\n      \"Accept-Language\": \"en_US\"\n    ]\n\n    client_id = Application.get_env(:my_app, :paypal)[:client_id]\n    client_secret = Application.get_env(:my_app, :paypal)[:client_secret]\n\n    options = [\n      hackney: [basic_auth: {client_id, client_secret}]\n    ]\n\n    body = \"grant_type=client_credentials\"\n\n    case HTTPoison.post(@auth_token_url, body, headers, options) do\n      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->\n        %{\"access_token\" => access_token} = Jason.decode!(body)\n        {:ok, access_token}\n\n      error ->\n        Logger.error(inspect(error))\n        {:error, :no_access_token}\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp verify_event(conn, auth_token, raw_body) do\n    headers = [\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      Authorization: \"Bearer #{auth_token}\"\n    ]\n\n    body =\n      %{\n        transmission_id: get_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-id\"),\n        transmission_time: get_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-time\"),\n        cert_url: get_header(conn, \"paypal-cert-url\"),\n        auth_algo: get_header(conn, \"paypal-auth-algo\"),\n        transmission_sig: get_header(conn, \"paypal-transmission-sig\"),\n        webhook_id: Application.get_env(:papervault, :paypal)[:webhook_id],\n        webhook_event: \"raw_body\"\n      }\n      |> Jason.encode!()\n      |> String.replace(\"\\\"raw_body\\\"\", raw_body)\n\n    with {:ok, %{status_code: 200, body: encoded_body}} <-\n           HTTPoison.post(@verification_url, body, headers),\n         {:ok, %{\"verification_status\" => \"SUCCESS\"}} <- Jason.decode(encoded_body) do\n      :ok\n    else\n      error ->\n        Logger.error(inspect(error))\n        {:error, :not_verified}\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp get_header(conn, key) do\n    conn |> get_req_header(key) |> List.first()\n  end\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61399557", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

The problem I'm having is with commentcount or (COUNT(comments.codeid) AS commentcount) - I want to count the total number of comments a code submission has. Previously, it was working correctly but I restructured my MySQL syntax and now it's stopped working :(\nThere's only 2 code submissions in the database that have comments.

Then see where your duplicate rows are coming from, and fix your original query.  This will fix your COUNTs as well.\n\nA: Try either:\nCOUNT(DISTINCT comments.codeid) AS commentcount\n\nor\n(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE comments.codeid = code.id) AS commentcount\n\n\nA: Try starting with a simple query, and building up from that.  If I have understood your structure correctly, the following query will return the correct number of comments for each code submission:\nSELECT code.*, COUNT(code.id) AS comment_count\nFROM code\nJOIN comments ON comments.codeid = code.id\nGROUP BY(code.id);\n\nThere's a few odd looking column names and joins in your example, which may be contributing to the problem \u0085 or it might just be an odd naming scheme :-)\nFor example, you are joining ratingItems to code by comparing code.id with ratingItems.uniqueName.  That might be correct, but it doesn't quite look right.  Perhaps it should be more like:\nLEFT JOIN ratingItems ON ratingItems.code_id = code.id\n\nStart with a basic working query, then add the other joins.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3193323", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)\nI have downloaded the MySQL .Net connector and in the Server Explorer I was able to view the tables on that DB.  I also have made sure that the DBs on the server allows for remote connections.\nI am creating and running the code locally via VS2010 and the MySQL DB is on hosted server.\nWhat do I have to do to get this MVC2 example to function for MySQL?\nUpdate:\nI was playing around with the code while waiting for an answer and I updated the ProductsController to the following:\nusing MySql.Data.MySqlClient;\n            string connString = \"server=xx.xx.xxx.xxx;Database=db_SportsStore;User Id=dbUser;Pwd=xxxxxx;\";\n            var connection = new MySqlConnection(connString);\n\n            productsRepository = new SportsStore.Domain.Concrete.SqlProductsRepository(connection);\n\nThen in the repository:\npublic SqlProductsRepository(MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection connection)\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    productsTable = (new DataContext(connection)).GetTable<Product>();\n    connection.Close();\n}\n\nNow I get a totally different error:\n{\"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '[t0].[ProductID], [t0].[Name], [t0].[Description], [t0].[Price], [t0].[Category]' at line 1\"}\nI should also mention...

(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-net-connection-options.html)\n\n*In your SQLProductsRepository you'll need to use the MySQLConnection Object and so forth instead of a SQLConnection object if used.  I think the book used Linq To SQL or Linq to Entity Framework.  Either way you'll have to modify the code to use the MySQL... objects or modify the model to hit your MySQL if it's Entity Framework.  If you already did this then the connection string in it will give a good idea of what you need in #1.\n\n\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-net-tutorials-intro.html\nEDIT - With your update...\nMySQL doesn't have the same syntax as SQL Server sometimes.  I am assuming that is what this error is pointing to.  \nOn the MySQL Connector connection string, it has an option to use SQL Server Syntax called SQL Server Mode.  Set this to true and see if this works....\nSomething like:\nServer=serverIP;Database=dbName;Uid=Username;Pwd=Password;SQL Server Mode=true;\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5843376", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

If I have a 1GB SQLite file with queries that take 40ms to complete locally, how many IOP's would this use?

In real case I will have banner for more than 500 IPs and timestamp in one json file from I which I have to filtered for 290 IPs and timestamp.\nOutput :\n{\n  \"asn\": \"AS17676\",\n  \"hash\": 1371060454,\n  \"ip\": 2120509894,\n  \"isp\": \"Softbank BB\",\n  \"transport\": \"udp\",\n  \"data\": \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nCache-Control: max-age=1800\\r\\nST: upnp:rootdevice\\r\\nUSN: uuid:63041253-1019-2006-1228-00018efed688::upnp:rootdevice\\r\\nEXT:\\r\\nServer: OS 1.0 UPnP/1.0 Realtek/V1.3\\r\\nLocation:   http://192.168.2.1:52881/simplecfg.xml\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n  \"port\": 1900,\n  \"hostnames\": [\n  \"softbank126100105198.bbtec.net\"\n],\n  \"location\": {\n  \"city\": \"Yamashitacho\",\n  \"region_code\": \"18\",\n  \"area_code\": null,\n  \"longitude\": 130.55,\n  \"country_code3\": \"JPN\",\n  \"latitude\": 31.58330000000001,\n  \"postal_code\": \"892-0816\",\n  \"dma_code\": null,\n  \"country_code\": \"JP\",\n  \"country_name\": \"Japan\"\n},\n  \"timestamp\": \"2018-08-11T04:56:17.312039\",\n  \"domains\": [\n  \"bbtec.net\"\n],\n  \"org\": \"Softbank BB\",\n  \"os\": null,\n  \"_shodan\": {\n  \"crawler\": \"6ff540e4d43ec69d8de2a7b60e1de2d9ddb406dc\",\n  \"options\": {},\n  \"module\": \"upnp\",\n  \"id\": null\n },\n  \"opts\": {},\n  \"ip_str\": **\"126.100.105.198\"**\n}\n\nActual Result:\nI am getting the filtered output/json banner based on filter parameter (here in this case ip_str and timestamp) for one single combination by running the above code.\n     jq '. | select (.timestamp=\"2018-08-11T04:56:17.312039\") | select(.ip_str==\"126.100.105.198\")' extract_3month_fromshodan.json > all.json\nActual Problem:\nBut the problem is I have to run the above code manually for 290 times for  IP's which is trouble some.

{"text": "Q: Why is my DelegatingHandler firing for MVC requests? I have a hybrid MVC/Web API project and I added a simple DelegatingHandler implementation to wrap the API responses. This works great, but the handler is also being invoked for requests to MVC controllers. My understanding is that DelegatingHandlers are only invoked for API routes.\nI'm using OWIN and some attribute routes if that matters. The relevant code in Startup.cs is:\nvar config = new HttpConfiguration();\n// ...\nvar debugging = HttpContext.Current == null || HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled;\nconfig.MessageHandlers.Add(new ApiResponseDelegatingHandler(debugging));\n\nThis causes both API and web requests to be wrapped and sent as JSON. Commenting it out resolves the problem but API requests are not wrapped. The error message on a web page is:\n\nNo HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI 'xxx'. No\n  route data was found for this request.\n\nI tried forcing the order that routes are registered so that MVC routes are added before Web API but that didn't help.\n\nA: This is easy to reproduce and I'm not sure if it's a bug or not.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new web app using the ASP.NET MVC template\n\n*Install the Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Owin and\nMicrosoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb NuGet packages \n\n*Move Web API startup from WebApiConfig.cs to a new Startup.cs file\n\n*Create a DelegatingHandler and add it to config.MessageHandlers in the Startup class\n\n*The DelegatingHandler will be invoked for MVC and API requests\n\n\nI tried several combinations of initializing in Startup.cs and WebApiConfig.cs without success.

{"text": "Q: Models haskell Beginner Hi there im new to haskell and im stuck on this Question, which is given a formula, it returns the model of that formula, where the Model is a valuation which makes the formula true. An example would be model eg ==[[(\"p\",True),(\"q\",True)],[(\"p\",True),(\"q\",False)]]\nUsing this definiton of Prop:\n          data Prop = Falsum   -- a contradiction, or\n         |Var Variable -- a  variable,or \n         |Not Prop -- a negation of a formula, or\n         |Or Prop Prop -- a disjunction of two formulae,or\n        |And Prop Prop -- a conjunction of two formulae, or \n        |Imp Prop Prop -- a conditional of two formulae\n          deriving (Eq,show)\n\nAnd Valuations:\nvaluations ::[Variable]->[Valuation]\nvaluations [] = [[]]\nvaluations (v:vs) = map ((v,True):) ds ++ map ((v,False):) ds \n where ds = valuations vs \n\nSo far I have this code:\nmodels :: Prop-> Prop-> Bool\nmodels p q = and $ valuations (p == q)\n\nHowever it doesn't seem to be working and I've been stuck on this for a while so was wondering if anyone can help out?\n\nA: This is the same homework question that I am trying to answer. It appears that your understanding of the question is somewhat incorrect. They type line for models should be:\nmodels :: Prop -> [Valuation]\nYou are trying to return only the formulas that give an overall evaluation of True.\nexample = And p (Or q (Not q))\nWhen 'example' is passed to the models function it produces the following list:\n[[(\"p\",True),(\"q\",True)],[(\"p\",True),(\"q\",False)]]\nThis is because an And statement can only ever evaluate to True if both inputs are True. The second input of the And statement, (Or q (Not q)) always evaluates to True as an Or statement always evaluates to True if one of the inputs is True. This is always the case in our example as our Or can be either (Or True (Not True)) or (Or False (Not False)) and both will always evaluate to True. So as long as the first input evaluates to True then the overall And statement will evaluate to True.\nValuations has to be passed a list of Variables and you have a function that does this. If you pass it just the Var \"p\" then you get [[(\"p\",True)],[(\"p\",False)]] as those are the only two possible combinations.\nWhat you (we) are wanting is to pass the Valuations list and only return those that evaluate to True. For example if your list was just Var \"p\" and your formula was Not p then only the second list, [(\"p\",False)], would be returned as p only evaluates to True when you assign False to Not p as Not False = True.\nAlmost forgot, all the possible combinations for And p (Or q (Not q)) --remember (Or q (Not q) is True\nAnd False (False (Not False))    = And False True = False -- [(\"p\",False),(\"q\",False)]]\nAnd False True  (True (Not True) = And False True = False -- [(\"p\",False),(\"q\",True)]]\nAnd True  (False (Not False))    = And True  True = True  -- [(\"p\",True),(\"q\",False)]]\nAnd True  (True (Not True)       = And True  True = True  -- [(\"p\",True),(\"q\",True)]]\nAs you can see the bottom two lines are the ones the homework question says will be returned. I just haven't worked out how to finish it myself yet.  I can get the full list of [Valuations] I just can't work out how to get only the True ones and discard the ones that evaluate False.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20036293", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "-2"}}

I don't really care about the preview size, because it doesn't affect the app (this card will be shown into a list and have the appropriate size later), but I'd like to get the color right.\nThe structure Theme that's used to specify the colors is defined in the file Theme.swift:\nimport SwiftUI\n\nenum Theme: String {\n    case bubblegum\n    case buttercup\n    case indigo\n    case lavender\n    case magenta\n    case navy\n    case orange\n    case oxblood\n    case periwinkle\n    case poppy\n    case purple\n    case seafoam\n    case sky\n    case tan\n    case teal\n    case yellow\n    \n    var accentColor: Color {\n        switch self {\n        case .bubblegum, .buttercup, .lavender, .orange, .periwinkle, .poppy, .seafoam, .sky, .tan, .teal, .yellow: return .black\n        case .indigo, .magenta, .navy, .oxblood, .purple: return .white\n        }\n    }\n    var mainColor: Color {\n        Color(rawValue)\n    }\n}\n\nAnd the specified colors in the enumeration are .json Assets in Xcode with this folder structure. However, the online tutorial doesn't specify how Xcode knows to look for them without any explicit references to these folders or .json files in the code for Theme.swift.\nI tried recreating the same folder structure within Playgrounds (which was painful since you can't import folders), but my output didn't change.\nSo here are my questions:\n\n*\n\n*How does Xcode link assets to custom data models (such as the enum in Theme.swift) that don't specifically reference it? Can I reproduce this with just code in Swift Playgrounds on iPad?\n\n*If I can't do that in Swift Playgrounds, do I have an alternative for creating custom colors and having them work with the enum in Theme.swift?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nA: Following @loremipsum's suggestion, I replaced the mainColor property of the Theme enumeration with\nvar mainColor: Color {\n    switch self {\n        case .bubblegum: return Color(red: 0.933, green: 0.502, blue: 0.820)\n        case .buttercup: return Color(red: 1.000, green: 0.945, blue: 0.588)\n        case .indigo: return Color(red: 0.212, green: 0.000, blue: 0.443)\n        case .lavender: return Color(red: 0.812, green: 0.808, blue: 1.000)\n        case .magenta: return Color(red: 0.647, green: 0.075, blue: 0.467)\n        case .navy: return Color(red: 0.000, green: 0.078, blue: 0.255)\n        case .orange: return Color(red: 1.000, green: 0.545, blue: 0.259)\n        case .oxblood: return Color(red: 0.290, green: 0.027, blue: 0.043)\n        case .periwinkle: return Color(red: 0.525, green: 0.510, blue: 1.000)\n        case .poppy: return Color(red: 1.000, green: 0.369, blue: 0.369)\n        case .purple: return Color(red: 0.569, green: 0.294, blue: 0.949)\n        case .seafoam: return Color(red: 0.796, green: 0.918, blue: 0.898)\n        case .sky: return Color(red: 0.431, green: 0.573, blue: 1.000)\n        case .tan: return Color(red: 0.761, green: 0.608, blue: 0.494)\n        case .teal: return Color(red: 0.133, green: 0.561, blue: 0.620)\n        case .yellow: return Color(red: 1.000, green: 0.875, blue: 0.302)\n    }\n}\n\ncopying the RGB values for the themes from the .json asset files. This has fixed the problem and now colors appear as intended.\nWhat I don't understand is why SwiftUI couldn't process Color(rawValue) for the example data used in CardView(), which was DailyScrum(title: \"Design\", attendees: [\"Cathy\", \"Daisy\", \"Simon\", \"Jonathan\"], lengthInMinutes: 10, theme: .yellow). Sure, .periwinkle might not be previously defined, but .yellow certainly is. In fact, if I rewrite mainColor from Color(rawValue) to Color(.yellow), I get all cards colored yellow without having to pass any RGB value.\nSo what's Color(rawValue) getting from the enumeration that it's unable to process .yellow when passed from rawValue?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70765916", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Easiest way to write and read an XML I'd like to know what is the easiest way to write to and parse a XML file in Android.\nMy requirement is very simple.

But for something truly this trivial, you could just use regexes -- here's my usual set, from which you'd need mainly 'attrlist' and 'stag' (for attribute list and start-tag).\nxname      = \"([_\\\\w][-_:.\\\\w\\\\d]*)\";         # XML NAME (imperfect charset)\nxnmtoken   = \"([-_:.\\\\w\\\\d]+)\";               #\nxncname    = \"([_\\\\w][-_.\\\\w\\\\d]*)\";          #\nqlit       = '(\"[^\"]*\"|\\'[^\\']*\\')';          # Includes the quotes\nattr       = \"$xname\\\\s*=\\\\s*$qlit\";          # Captures name and value\nattrlist   = \"(\\\\s+$attr)*\";                  #\nstartTag   = \"<$xname$attrlist\\\\s*/?>\";       #\nendTag     = \"</$xname\\\\s*>\";                 #\ncomment    = \"(<!--[^-]*(-[^-]+)*-->)\";       # Includes delims\npi         = \"(<\\?$xname.*?\\?>)\";             # Processing instruction\ndcl        = \"(<!$xname\\\\s+[^>]+>)\";          # Markup dcl (imperfect)\ncdataStart = \"(<!\\[CDATA\\[)\";                 # Marked section open\ncdataEnd   = \"(]]>)\";                         # Marked section close\ncharRef    = \"&(#\\\\d+|#[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+);\";   # Num char ref (no delims)\nentRef     = \"&$xname;\";                      # Named entity ref\npentRef    = \"%$xname;\";                      # Parameter entity ref\nxtext      = \"[^<&]*\";                        # Neglects ']]>'\nxdocument  = \"^($startTag|$endTag|$pi|$comment|$entRef|$xtext)+\\$\";\n\nA draft of the XML spec even included a \"trivial\" grammar for XML, that can find node boundaries correctly, but not catch all errors, expanding entity references, etc. See https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xml-lang-970630#secF.\nThe main drawback is that if you run into fancier data later, it may break.

Let's start with database related code. Instead of mixing database related things (MySqlConnection, MySqlCommand etc.) with presentation layer things (SelectListItem, List<SelectListItem> etc.) and doing that also inside a Controller, you should\n\n*\n\n*Create a separate class for accessing the database and fetching the data.\n\n*The method that would be called should return a List of some kind of domain/entity object that would represent the Fruit.\n\nSo, let's define initially our class, Fruit:\npublic class Fruit\n{\n    public string Code { get; }\n    public string Name { get; }\n\n    public Fruit(string code, string name)\n    {\n        Code = code; \n        Name = name;\n    }\n}\n\nThen let's create a class that would be responsible for accessing the database and fetch the fruits:\npublic class FruitsRepository\n{\n    public List<Fruits> GetAll()\n    {\n        string sql;\n\n        var fruits = new List<Fruit>();\n\n        string constr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"cn\"].ConnectionString;\n\n        using (MySqlConnection con = new MySqlConnection(constr))\n        {\n            sql = @String.Format(\"SELECT * FROM `dotable`; \");\n\n            using (MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand(sql))\n            {\n                cmd.Connection = con;\n                con.Open();\n\n                using (MySqlDataReader sdr = cmd.ExecuteReader())\n                {\n                    while (sdr.Read())\n                    {\n                        var fruit = new Fruit(sdr[\"sCode\"].ToString(), sdr[\"sName\"].ToString());\n                        fruits.Add(fruit);\n                    }\n                }\n                con.Close();\n            }\n        }\n\n        return fruits;\n    }\n}\n\nNormally, this class should implement an interface, in order we decouple the controller from the actual class that performs the database operations, but let's not discuss this at this point.\nThen at your controller:\n\n*\n\n*We should use the above class to fetch the fruits.\n\n*We should create a list of SelectListItem objects and you would provide that list to the model.\n\n*We should change the model, in a way that it would hold an info about the selected fruit (check below).\n\n*We should change the view.\n\nChanges in the model\npublic class PersonModel\n{\n    [Required]\n    [Display(Name = \"Fruits\")] \n    public string SelectedFruitCode { get; set; }\n\n    public List<SelectListItem> Fruits { get; set; }\n\n    public string Namex { get; set; }\n    \n    public string Codex { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [Display(Name = \"CL\")] \n    public string CL { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [Display(Name = \"Ticket\")]\n    public string Ticket { get; set; }\n}\n\nChanges in the View\n@Html.DropDownListFor(model => model.SelectedFruitCode, Model.Fruits, \"[ === Please select === ]\", new { @Class = \"textarea\" })\n@Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.SelectedFruitCode, \"\", new { @class = \"text-danger\" })\n\nChanges in the Controller\n [HttpGet]\n public ActionResult Index()\n {\n     var personModel = new PersonModel();\n        \n     // THIS IS **BAD CODE**...Normaly, you should create an interface that describes\n     // what is expected from the class that communicates with the DB for operations\n     // related with the Fruit and then inject the dependency in the HomeController \n     // Constructor. \n        \n     var fruitsRepo = new FruitsRepository();\n     var fruits = fruitsRepo.GetAll();\n     var fruitsSelecteListItems = fruits.Select(fruit => new SelectListItem\n     {\n         Text = fruit.Name,\n         Value = fruit.Code\n     }).ToList();\n     personModel.Fruits = fruitsSelecteListItems; \n     return View(personModel);\n }\n\nPlease check thoroughly the comments in the code above ^^. As a starting point for that mentioned in the comments, you could see this.\nUPDATE\nWe have also to change the post action:\n[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult Index(PersonModel person)\n{\n    // Removed the Model.IsValid check since it's redundant in your case\n    // Usually we use it and when it is valid we perform a task, like update \n    // the corresponding object in the DB or doing something else. Otherwise,\n    // we return a view with errors to the client. \n    var fruitsRepo = new FruitsRepository();\n    var fruits = fruitsRepo.GetAll();\n    var fruitsSelecteListItems = fruits.Select(fruit => new SelectListItem\n    {\n        Text = fruit.Name,\n        Value = fruit.Code,\n        Selected = String.Equals(fruit.Code, \n                                 person.SelectedFruitCode,             \n                                        StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)\n    }).ToList();\n\n    person.Fruits = fruitsSelecteListItems;         \n\n    return View(person);\n}\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64941538", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

For example here, the clusters are: (group1,group2,group3),(group5,groupN) and group4. The overlapping elements in the 3 groups are shown below:\nCluster1: (group1,group2,group3): 57 91 107 108 Cluster Size: (Group1_size+group2_size+group3_size =85 <90) \nCluster2: group4: 1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 17 18 20 41 42 43 45 47 Cluster Size: (group4_size < 40)\nCluster3: (group5,groupN): 201 214 216 219 225 Cluster Size: (group5_size + groupN_size 70 <90)\n\nIf I include group5 in cluster1 then its size will be 85+30=115 and I want to return a size<90, therefore I can not include group4 in cluster1.\nThe elements in the respective clusters after removing the duplicate overlapping elements are:\nCluster1: (group1, group2, group3): 12 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 71 72 73 74 75 89 91 92 93 94 100 105 107 108 110 111 112 114 117 118 120 127 129 139 184\nCluster2: group4: 1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 17 18 20 41 42 43 45 47\nCluster3: (group5,groupN): 50 51 52 53 54 57 58 91 201 205 207 210 212 214 216 217 218 219 220 221 225 700 701 702 705 706 708\n\nIs there some existing algorithm or technique which may help me achieve this clustering with size constraint. \nI tried to form clusters by finding the common elements between any two groups and including in the group if cluster size after inclusion is <90. But is there any existing algorithm in any of the programming language libraries like C++,python,java which may help me achieve this efficiently. If not, then is there any existing algorithm which achieves the same.\nIf possible, it will be great if the algorithm is optimal also.\n\nA: There is no easy optimal solution. One approximation is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick the group with the largest size. Let its size be x\n\n*Pick the largest group such that its size is less than 90-x\n\n*Keep repeating step 2 until you cannot find such a group\n\n*Remove the selected groups and repeat the process starting from Step 1\n\n\nEg. You would pick group1 (or group4 or groupN) first is step 1. In step 2 you would pick group4. Now the size is 80 and there are no groups smaller than 90-80=10. So stop and remove these two groups. In the next iteration, you will select groupN, followed by group2, and at last group3. In the last iteration you have only one group, that is group5.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28560963", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Connecting to Cassandra on startup, and monitoring session health Two related questions \n1) Currently, the session to C* is established in  a lazy fashion - aka, only on the first any table is accessed.\nInstead, we would like to establish a session as soon as the application is started (in case there is a connectivity problem, etc. ). What would be the best way to do that? Should I just get a session object in my startup code? \nconnector.provider.session\n\n2) How would I then monitor the health of the connection?  I could call \nconnector.provider.session.isClosed()\n\nbut I'm not sure it will do the job. \n\nA: I wouldn't manually rely on that mechanism per say as you may want to get more metrics out of the cluster, for which purpose you have native JMX support, so through the JMX protocol you can look at metrics in more detail.\nNow obviously you have OpsCenter which natively leverages this feature, but alternatively you can use a combination of a JMX listener with something like Graphana(just a thought) or whatever supports native compatibility.\nIn terms of low level methods, yes, you are on the money:\nconnector.provider.session.isClosed()\nBut you also have heartbeats that you can log and look at and so on.

It renders 1D gradients as 2D spectrums into your sketch or a given PGraphics object.\nHere's an example of drawing linear and radial spectrums using your desired gradient:\nPeasyGradients renderer;\nPGraphics rectangle, circle, circleMask;\n\nfinal Gradient pinkToYellow = new Gradient(color(227, 140, 185), color(255, 241, 166));\n\nvoid setup() {\n  size(800, 800);\n\n  renderer = new PeasyGradients(this);\n\n  rectangle = createGraphics(100, 400);\n  renderer.setRenderTarget(rectangle); // render into rectangle PGraphics\n  renderer.linearGradient(pinkToYellow, PI/2); // gradient, angle\n\n  circle = createGraphics(400, 400);\n  renderer.setRenderTarget(circle);  // render into circle PGraphics\n  renderer.radialGradient(pinkToYellow, new PVector(200, 200), 0.5); // gradient, midpoint, zoom\n\n  // circle is currently a square image of a radial gradient, so needs masking to be circular  \n  circleMask = createGraphics(400, 400);\n  circleMask.beginDraw();\n  circleMask.fill(255); // keep white pixels\n  circleMask.circle(200, 200, 400);\n  circleMask.endDraw();\n\n  circle.mask(circleMask);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  background(255);\n\n  image(rectangle, 50, 50);\n\n  image(circle, 250, 250);\n}\n\n\n\nA: What you can try is make a PGraphics object for each rectangle you are drawing, fill it with gradient color using linear interpolation and then instead of using rect(x1, y1, x2, y2), in drawPaddle() use image(pgraphic, x, y).\nHere is how you can create a gradient effect using lerpColor() in processing:\n\n*\n\n*Make a start point say (x1, y1) and end point say (x2, y2) of the gradient.\n\n*Make a starting and a ending color say c1 and c2.\n\n*Now for a point P (x, y), calculate the distance between start point and P and divide it by the distance between the start point and and end point. This will be the 'amount' to lerp from start color and end color.\nfloat t = dist(x1, y1, x, y) / dist(x1, x2, y1, y2)\n\n*Put this value in lerpColor() as lerpColor(c1, c2, value). This will give you the color for point P.\n\n*Repeat the same for every point you want to calculate the gradient for.\n\nHere's an example:\nNote: here, i am taking t which is the amount to be lerped as the distance between the starting point of gradient divided by the distance between the start and end point of gradient, as it will always be a value in between 0 and 1.\nPGraphics g = createGraphics(50, 200); // set these values to the size(width, height) of paddle you want \n    color startColor = color(255, 25, 25); // color of start of the gradient\n    color endColor   = color(25, 25, 255); // color of end of the gradient\n    \n    g.beginDraw(); //start drawing in this as you would draw in the screen\n    g.loadPixels();//load pixels, as we are going to set the color of this, pixel-by-pixel\n    \n    int x1 = g.width/2;\n    int y1 = 0;\n    int x2 = g.width/2;\n    int y2 = g.height;\n    \n    // (x1, y1) is the start point of gradient\n    // (x2, y2) is the end point of gradient\n    \n    // loop through all the pixels\n    for (int x=0; x<g.width; x++) {\n        for (int y=0; y<g.height; y++) {\n            \n            //amout to lerp, the closer this is to (x2, y2) it will get closer to endColor\n            float t = dist(x1, y1, x, y) / dist(x1, y1, x2, y2);\n            \n            // you need to convert 2D indices to 1D, as pixels[] is an 1D array\n            int index = x + y * g.width;\n            g.pixels[index] = lerpColor(startColor, endColor, t);\n        }\n    }\n    g.updatePixels(); // update the pixels\n    g.endDraw(); // we are done drawing into this\n    \n    // Now, you can draw this using image(g, x, y);\n\nHere is the result when i created this in the global scope and then drew it in draw() using image(g, width/2 ,height/2):\n\nNow, you can modify everything to your preference.\nPlease mark this as answer if it helped you in any way.\n\nA: Nice question and great mycycle and void main's answers are great already.\nThe PeasyGradients library looks great!\nI would like to contribute a minor workaround: using the P2D renderer to handle the gradient via shapes:\nsize(100,100,P2D);// render via OpenGL\nnoStroke();\n// draw the rect by manually setting vertices\nbeginShape();\n// gradient start\nfill(#fef1a6);\nvertex(0  ,  0); // TL  \nvertex(100,  0); // TR\n// gradient end\nfill(#e28ab9);\nvertex(100,100); // BR\nvertex(  0,100); // BL\n\nendShape();\n\n\nFor more complex shapes this could be used be used in conjuction with mask(). Not only PImage can be masked, but also PGraphics, since they inherit from PImage:\nPGraphics gradient;\nPGraphics mask;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  size(640, 360, P2D);\n  \n  gradient = getGradientRect(width, height, #fef1a6, #e28ab9);\n  mask = getMaskRect(width, height);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  background(#483b6c);\n  drawPongShapes();\n  // apply pong shapes mask to gradient\n  gradient.mask(mask);\n  // render masked gradient\n  image(gradient, 0, 0);\n}\n// draw white shapes (masks) on black background\nvoid drawPongShapes(){\n  mask.beginDraw();\n  mask.background(0);\n  mask.ellipse(width * 0.5, height * 0.5, 60, 60);\n  mask.rect(width * .25, mouseY, 30, 150);\n  mask.rect(width * .75, height-mouseY, 30, 150);\n  mask.endDraw();\n}\n\nPGraphics getMaskRect(int w, int h) {\n  PGraphics layer = createGraphics(w, h, P2D);\n  layer.beginDraw();\n  layer.background(0);\n  layer.noStroke();\n  layer.fill(255);\n  layer.ellipseMode(CENTER);\n  layer.rectMode(CENTER);\n  layer.endDraw();\n  return layer;\n}\n\nPGraphics getGradientRect(int w, int h, color grad1, color grad2) {\n  PGraphics layer = createGraphics(w, h, P2D);\n  layer.beginDraw();\n  layer.noStroke();\n  // draw rect as shape quad\n  layer.beginShape();\n  \n  // gradient start\n  layer.fill(grad1);\n  layer.vertex(0, 0); // TL  \n  layer.vertex(w, 0); // TR\n  // gradient end\n  layer.fill(grad2);\n  layer.vertex(w, h); // BR\n  layer.vertex(0, h); // BL\n  \n  layer.endShape();\n  layer.endDraw();\n  return layer;\n}\n\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65756931", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: Popup when a new message arrives I have a fully functioning messaging system on my website.\nI want to evolve this by having a box popup altering members when they have a new message.\nIt would say something like \"You have a new message, would you like to view?\".\nYou would be able to click Yes or No.\nHow would I go about doing this?\nNever tried anything like this before!\nThanks\nUPDATE. \nI am very inexperienced using the technologies required here. \nHow would I go about ensuring this works on every page?\nWhat code would I include?\nThis is something I need to improve on as it opens up so many more possibilities!\n\nA: You can have a looping AJAX call in the background that checks every few minutes. If the server returns a URL (or something distinguishable from \"no messages\") then you'll get the popup, and if they hit OK, are sent to the URL (using a basic confirm() dialog in Javascript).\nBe careful though, the users patience will wear thin if you munch their CPU power on this.\n\nA: You'd have to check regulary with the server if a new message is present for the user, using a timer in your javascript (so clientside code). Due to the nature of HTTP (it being stateless) it is not possible to push this notification from the server.\n\nA: You have 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show the message every time the user reloads the page. Easy and fast.\n\n*Show the message by sending AJAX requests to the server. Can be really bad when you have many users, so make sure the response take very little time.\n\n*Send the message from the server using WebSocket. Most up-to-date technology, but it's only supported in a few browsers, so check the compatibility issues before implementing it.\n\n\nI'd personally use #1, if I don't need instant user reaction. #2 is good for web chatting. #3 is universal, but rarely used yet.\nNormally you would have an AJAX script in the background, running with long timeout (30+ seconds), and functionality that shows the message after page reload. This combines #1 and #2.\n\nA: Firstly you should look at the following:\nhttp://stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html\nyou should load jQuery + jGrowl and create a heartbeat function which polls the server every X seconds like.\nWhen the server receives a request from the JavaScript you check the database for the latest messages marked un_notified (not read)\nYou compile a list and mark them notified, and then send the list to the JavaScript again, this in turn gets passed to jGrowl and notifications are show,\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4575944", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

Once checking the logs, it showed me 'Error: secret option required for sessions'.\nHere is how I fixed it:\napp.use(session({\n  secret: 'secretidhere', \n  resave: false, \n  saveUninitialized: false\n}))\n\nSince my .env file wasn't viewable and that's where I had my secret code, it was giving me that error. Now, just by putting an arbitrary string 'secretidhere', I deployed to heroku again and it worked!\n** However, please note that this should not be a permanent solution. As the poster above states, you should have a config file in your root directory, or another method so this session stays secret. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: I was facing the same issue while I was deploying my code into AWS Elastic BeanStalk.\nIn .env we could have -\nsecret='my_secret'\n\nWhile in server.js:\napp.use(cookieParser())\napp.use(session({\n  resave:true,\n  saveUninitialized:true,\n  secret:process.env.secret,\n  cookie:{maxAge:3600000*24}\n}))\n\nThe solution turned out to be adding secret to the environments in there. Just add it to your enviroments for production, be it heroku or AWS.\n\nA: Have you added your secret session from your .env file to heroku config? Since your .env is in your .gitignore it will not be pushed up to heroku. Your code is looking for a string from your process.env but the heroku environment does not have it yet.\nYou have two solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your app console and click on settings. Once you are there, click on the box that says reveal config vars and add your secret there.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*In the root directory of your project you can set your config vars there using the command \n\n\nheroku config:set SECRET_SESSION=\"secretName\"\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528070", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Concurrency, Locking in SQL Server Database I have a requirement to Save/Update data in 15 tables. I have to ensure at the time of updation the concurrency and locking should be maintained, so that no dirty read happens. I am updating data using storeed procedure. What I can do in oredr to implement locking and concurrency?\n\nA: Other answers are assuming that you are already using a transaction. I won't omit this, since you might be missing it.\nYou should use a transaction to ensure that records in all 15 tables or none are inserted/updated. The transaction ensures you atomicity in your operation. If something fails during the stored procedure and you don't use a transaction, some of the save/update operations will be made, and some not (the ones from the query that has produced the error).\nIf you use BEGIN TRAN, and COMMIT for successful operations or ROLLBACK in case of failure, you will get all done or nothing. You should check for errors after each query execution, and call ROLLBACK TRANSACTION if there is one, or call COMMIT at the end of the stored procedure.\nThere is a good sample in the accepted answer of this Stackoverflow question on how to handle transaction inside a stored procedure. \nOnce you have the transaction, the second part is how to avoid dirty reads. You can set the isolation level of your database to READ COMMITED, this will prevent, by default, dirty reads on your data. But the user can still chose to do dirty reads by specifying WITH (NOLOCK) or READUNCOMMITED in his query. You cannot prevent that.\nBesides, there are the snapshot isolation levels (Snapshot and Read Commited Snapshot) that could prevent locking (which is not always good), avoiding dirty reads at the same time.\nThere is a lot of literature on this topic over the internet. If you are interested in snapshot isolation levels, I suggest you to read this great article from Kendra Little at Brent Ozar.\n\nA: You can't prevent that dirty read does not happen. Is the reader that does the dirty reads, not you (the writer). All you can do is ensure that your write is atomic, and that is accomplished by wrapping all writes in a single transaction. This way readers that do not issue dirty reads will see either all your updates, either none (atomic).\nIf a reader chooses to issue dirty reads there's nothing you can do about it.\nNote that changing your isolation level has no effect whatsoever on the reader's isolation level.\n\nA: All you need to do to ensure that the sql server isolation level is set appropriately.  To eliminate dirty reads, it needs to be at Read Committed or higher, (Not at Read Uncommitted). Read Committed is the default setting out of the box.    \nIt might be worth while, however, to review the link above and see what benefits, (and consequences) the higher settings provide.\n\nA: You can set the transaction isolation level to SERIALIZABLE. by using the following statement \nSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; \n\nBefore you BEGIN TRANSACTION but Warning it can slow down other user who will be try to see on update or insert data into your tables, Your can also make use of the SNAP_SHOT Isolation Level which shows you only the last Commited/Saved data but it makes extensive use of Temp DB which can also effect the performance.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19361525", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Setting up a Git repository for a .NET solution I have a solution with 15 C# projects and I'm trying to set up an efficient git repository for them. Should I create a repository on that level or for each project under the solution?\nWebServices/\n|- WebServices.sln\n|- WebService1/\n `- WebService1.csproj\n|- WebService2/\n `- WebService2.csproj\n\nThe solution has a project reference to ../framework/framework.csproj which is a seperate repository and all the other projects have a reference to. The projects under the solution are not linked in any way, but they all use the framework.\nI would like any changes to the framework would be passed to the projects.\nDo you have any guide for me how to achieve that in the best possible way?\n\nA: There is no one answer to how to set up your repository.  It depend on your specific needs.\nSome questions you should ask yourself include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are all projects going to be released and versioned separately?\n\n*Are the projects really independent of each other?\n\n*How is your development team structured?  Do individual developers stick to a single project?\n\n*Is your framework project stable?\n\n*Does your build process build each project separately?\n\n\nAssuming that the answers to all of the above is \"yes\", then I would set it up like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Continue maintaining the framework code in its own repository, and publish it to an internal server using NuGet (as suggested in ssube's comment).\n\n*Create a separate repository for each project, each with their own solution file.\n\n\nIf you can say \"yes\" to all except #5 (and possibly #1), above, then I would add one more repository that consists of submodules of each of the individual projects and a global solution file that your build server can use.  If you add a new project, you have to remember to also update this repository!\nIf you have to say \"no\" to #2, then just build a single repository.\nIf you have to say \"no\" to #3, then you'll have to make a judgement call, between separation of the code and developers' need to switch between repos.  You could create a separate repository including submodules, but if all your developers wind up using that repo, you are really only introducing new maintenance with little gain.\nIf your framework is not stable (#4), then you may want to include that as a submodule in any of these cases.  I recommend that once it becomes stable, then you look into removing the submodule and switching to NuGet at that time.\n\nA: What i have done for such a situation was the following. Note that in my case there were 2-3 developers.\nSo i have 3 things in this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The empty project structure that i would like to replicate [OPTIONAL]\n\n*The common library projects\n\n*The actual end projects that use common library projects\n\n\n1) I just create my scaffold development directory structure and i am putting a .gitkeep file in each and everyone of them in order for git to include it. In this way when i want to setup myself in a new pc i just clone this and i have my empty development \"universe\" structure. Then i populate (git clone) with the projects i need.\n2) The common libraries project is just a normal repo.\n3) My end projects reference the common library projects. There are prons and cons about it and depends on your situation, but i what i gain is that i can change the common libraries either directly from the common library project, or from the end project which references it. In both ways i get the changes in git and commit normally and separately.\nIn your case i would have my empty structure and then do 2 separate clones. The framework project in the correct place and then the entire webservices repo.\nIts up to you if you want to have a separate repo for each web service or one for all. It depends on your person count and work flow.\nAlso do not forget a proper .gitignore Here: LINK\n\nA: If \n\n\n*\n\n*you really want to have all projects in the same solution\n\n*the common project \"Framework\" is in active development (and some modifications\nfor one project could break others...)\n\n\ni think you must have each WebService as a git project with his own copy of Framework project as submodule:\nWebServices/\n|- WebServices.sln\n|- WebService1/\n `|-.git  \n  |-WebService1.csproj\n  |-Framework (as submodule)\n|- WebService2/\n `|-.git  \n  |-WebService2.csproj\\\n  |-Framework (as submodule)\n\nThis way each WebService will use the Framework version that is compatible with. \n(of course you must be aware of git submodule workings... you could read for example this, specially the section \"Issues with Submodules\"!)\nImportant: with this configuration each deployed webservice must reference the Framework library with the actual version it is using!\n\nA: Depending on \"how independent\" development going to be for each of your projects you might consider two option.\n\n\n*\n\n*in case you are mostly working on entire solution - create one repo for entire solution\n\n*in case some projects are really independent , create separate repos for those projects and create solution file for each project aside project file, then use git submodules to reference those repos in the repo of the main solution, that make use of those projects.\nGit Submodules Tips\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23414771", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

I'd like to pull the Decider logic out into, say, MyDecider.scala and find a way to refactor the Supervisor so that its supervisorStrategy uses an instance of MyDecider, so maybe something similar to:\nclass Supervisor extends Actor {\n  import akka.actor.OneForOneStrategy\n  import akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy._\n  import scala.concurrent.duration._\n\n  var child: ActorRef = _\n\n  override val supervisorStrategy =\n    OneForOneStrategy(maxNrOfRetries = 10, withinTimeRange = 1 minute, decider = myDecider)\n\n  ...\n}\n\n\nA: For #2 you could access the sender \"if the strategy is declared inside the supervising actor\"\n\nIf the strategy is declared inside the supervising actor (as opposed to within a companion object) its decider has access to all internal state of the actor in a thread-safe fashion, including obtaining a reference to the currently failed child (available as the sender of the failure message).\n\nThe message is not made available so the only option is to catch your exception and throw a custom one with the message that was received. \nHere is a quick fiddle\nclass ActorSO extends Actor {\n\n  def _receive: Receive = {\n    case e =>\n      println(e)\n      throw new RuntimeException(e.toString)\n  }\n\n  final def receive = {\n    case any => try {\n      _receive(any)\n    }\n    catch {\n      case t:Throwable => throw new ActorException(self,t,any)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nUpdate\nA Decider is just a PartialFunction so you can pass it in the constructor.\nobject SupervisorActor {\n  def props(decider: Decider) = Props(new SupervisorActor(decider))\n}\n\nclass SupervisorActor(decider: Decider) extends Actor {\n\n  override val supervisorStrategy = OneForOneStrategy()(decider)\n\n  override def receive: Receive = ???\n}\n\nclass MyDecider extends Decider {\n  override def isDefinedAt(x: Throwable): Boolean = true\n\n  override def apply(v1: Throwable): SupervisorStrategy.Directive = {\n    case t:ActorException => Restart\n    case notmatched => SupervisorStrategy.defaultDecider.apply(notmatched)\n  }\n}\n\nobject Test {\n  val myDecider: Decider = {\n    case t:ActorException => Restart\n    case notmatched => SupervisorStrategy.defaultDecider.apply(notmatched)\n  }\n  val myDecider2 = new MyDecider()\n  val system = ActorSystem(\"stackoverflow\")\n  val supervisor = system.actorOf(SupervisorActor.props(myDecider))\n  val supervisor2 = system.actorOf(SupervisorActor.props(myDecider2))\n}\n\nBy doing so, you won't be able to access supervisor state like the ActorRef of the child that throw the exception via sender() (although we are including this in the ActorException)\nRegarding your original question of accessing from the supervisor the child message that cause the exception, you can see here (from akka 2.5.3) that the akka developers choose to not make it available for decision.\n  final protected def handleFailure(f: Failed): Unit = {\n    // \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 currentMessage.message is the one that cause the exception !!!\n    currentMessage = Envelope(f, f.child, system)\n    getChildByRef(f.child) match {\n      /*\n       * only act upon the failure, if it comes from a currently known child;\n       * the UID protects against reception of a Failed from a child which was\n       * killed in preRestart and re-created in postRestart\n       */\n      case Some(stats) if stats.uid == f.uid \u21d2\n        // \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 currentMessage.message is not passed to the handleFailure !!!\n        if (!actor.supervisorStrategy.handleFailure(this, f.child, f.cause, stats, getAllChildStats)) throw f.cause\n      case Some(stats) \u21d2\n        publish(Debug(self.path.toString, clazz(actor),\n          \"dropping Failed(\" + f.cause + \") from old child \" + f.child + \" (uid=\" + stats.uid + \" != \" + f.uid + \")\"))\n      case None \u21d2\n        publish(Debug(self.path.toString, clazz(actor), \"dropping Failed(\" + f.cause + \") from unknown child \" + f.child))\n    }\n  }\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50353738", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

The end goal is to be able to read the posts from a facebook page.\nIf someone has connected with my app on facebook can my c# application then get the posts from a public facebook page if it knows their facebook account id (and has the facebook app secret hard coded).\nIf so what are the http requests it needs to make in order to get the access token which can then be used to get the posts, and what are the requests to get a new access token before one expires?\nIf you could provide an example in c# (maybe using the acebooksdk.net library) that would be great!\nThanks.\n\nA: The way to do it was using \"The Login Flow for Web (without JavaScript SDK)\" api to get a user access token. A user access token is required to be sent with graph api queries in order to get page posts.\nThe first step is to create an app on facebook where you specify what information you want the program to be able to access via the graph api. The end user will then choose to accept these permissions later.\nThe program creates a web browser frame and navigates to https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id={app-id}&redirect_uri=https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&response_type=token\nThe response type \"token\" means that when the (embedded) web browser is redirected to the redirect_uri the user access token will be added to the end of the url as a fragment.

Some information they may require is for them to login and accept permissions your app on facebook requires.\nSo the program simply keeps an eye on what url the embedded browser is on and when it matches the redirect_uri it parses the url which will contain the data as fragments and can then close the browser. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18196667", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

I'm using Node.js v8.16.2 and NPM v6.4.1.\n\nA: The error happens because } catch { is a relatively recent (ES2019) language feature called \"optional catch binding\"; prior to its introduction, binding the caught error (e.g. } catch (err) {) was required syntactically. Per node.green, you need at least Node 10 to have that language feature.\nSo why does this happen in ESLint? Per e.g. the release blog, version 7 has dropped support for Node 8; they're no longer testing against that version and more modern language features will be assumed to be supported.\nTo fix it, either:\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade Node (Node 8 is out of LTS, which is why ESLint dropped support); or\n\n*npm install eslint@6 (with -g if you want to install globally) to use the older version of ESLint with Node 8 support.\n\n\nA: In case it's helpful for anyone, I had a slightly different twist on the other answer.

Creating a read-only user in pgAdmin 4 is a little tricky.\nHere is a guide on how I did it.\nFirst of all a few words about the process.\nThe whole process is based on editing a schema (very simple and safe) for your DB, so this creates limitations for using the method for all the DBs you have unless you edit schemas for each DB (again, it is easy).\nFirst, we have to open a main dialogue, select the target DB you need the read-only user for -> Schemas -> right mouse click on \"public\" schema -> Properties.\n\nIn the opened window go to \"Default privileges\" and click the \"+\" in the right corner.\n\n*\n\n*In the \"Grantee\" column enter: \"pg_read_all_data\",\n\n*in \"Privileges\" column click on the field and you will see options. Enable only \"Select\".\n\n\nOn the rest tabs (Sequences, Functions, Types) you can do the same (Select or Usage).\nHit \"Save\".\nIn the left sidebar scroll down and find \"Login/Group Roles\". Click right button -> Create -> Login/Group Role.\nOR if you have an existed user role you want to make read-only, click the right button on it and select \"Properties\".\nIn the opened window enter the name of the user, on the \"Definition\" tab enter a password, on the \"Previliges\" tab select \"Can login\" and \"Inherit rights from the parent roles?\"\nIn the \"Membership\" tab hit \"+\" in the \"Member of\" table and type \"pg_read_all_data\" into the \"User/Role\" column.\n\nIn the \"Parameters\" tab hit \"+\".\nSelect \"role\" in the \"Name\" column's dropdown,\ntype \"pg_read_all_data\" in the \"Value\" column.\nIn the \"Database\" column select the desired DB (where you have edited the schema in the previous steps).\nNote, you can add more rows with the same settings for different databases (of course, if those DBs have edited schemas as shown above).\n\nClick \"Save\".\nNow you can log into your PhpPgAdmin (or psql or wherever you need) under this user and do only selects. A real read-only user role.\n\nI hope it will help someone.\n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to comment on your very helpful post, but wanted to add that the public schema by default gives full access to the PUBLIC role (implicit role that all users belong to).\nSo you would first need to revoke this access.\nThis can be done in pgAdmin in the Security tab of the schema properties dialog, or with the SQL command\nREVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;\n\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*Issue creating read-only user in PostgreSQL that results in user with greater permission with public schema\n\n*PostgreSQL - Who or what is the \"PUBLIC\" role?\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72791383", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7"}}

{"text": "Q: Linking to iOS simulator binaries on OSX I was curious what would happen if I linked to an iOS simulator framework in a Mac app. So I copied UIKit to it's own folder (so the Framework search path wouldn't include all the iOS simulator framework, as like CoreFoundation is both on Mac and iOS but has different headers), and dragged it into the link section in Xcode. The error Xcode gave me was: \n\nbuilding for MacOSX, but linking against dylib built for iOS Simulator\n  file '/Users/jonathan/Desktop/macuikit/UIKit.framework/UIKit' for\n  architecture x86_64\n\nBoth architectures are x86_64, so how can it tell the framework is specifically for the iOS simulator, I removed all references to iOS in things like Info.plist, even tried deleted everything but the UIKit binary, but the same error came up. Is there something in the binary it self that tells the linker which platform it can run on, rather than just the architecture? I looked at the Mach-O header but there is only fields for CPU type and subtype, and neither has a value for the simulator as expected.\n\nA: After a little bit of digging, it turns out that the platform on which the library can run on is indeed specified in the binary. In fact, you can edit the binary in your favorite Hex editor and make the linker skip this check entirely.\nThis information is not specified in the Mach-O header (as you have already realized). Instead, it is specified as a load command type. You can see the available types by digging through the LLVM sources. Specifically, the enum values LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX and LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS look interesting.\nNow, find the offset for this in our binary. Open the same in MachOView (or any other editor/viewer or your choice) and note the offset:\n\nOnce the offset is noted, jump to the same in a Hex editor and update it. I modified LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS (25) to LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX (24)\nSave the updates and try linking again. The error should go away.

For more information on type visibility outside the assembly, see Type Visibility. This change was primarily driven by the needs of developers using other, case-insensitive languages, when referencing metadata authored in Visual C++.\nYou can confirm this using Ildasm or reflector, you will see that your extract method is compiled as:\npublic unsafe void Extract(basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >* modopt(IsImplicitlyDereferenced) data_)\n\nwith basic_string being compiled as:\n[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Size=0x20), NativeCppClass, MiscellaneousBits(0x40), DebugInfoInPDB, UnsafeValueType]\ninternal struct basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >\n\nNote the internal. \nUnfortunately you are then unable to call a such a method from a different assembly. \nThere is a workaround available in some cases: You can force the native type to be compiled as public using the make_public pragma. \ne.g. if you have a method Extract2 such as:\nvoid Extract2( std::exception& data_ );\n\nyou can force std::exception to be compiled as public by including this pragma statement beforehand:\n#pragma make_public(std::exception)\n\nthis method is now callable across assemblies. \nUnfortunately make_public does not work for templated types (std::string just being a typedef for basic_string<>)\nI don't think there is anything you can do to make it work. I recommend using the managed type System::String^ instead in all your public API. This also ensures that your library is easily callable from other CLR languages such as c#\n\nA: In addition to the solutions described above, one can subclass the templated type to obtain a non-templated type, and include its definition in both projects, thus overcoming some of the problems mentioned above.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/947213", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16"}}

{"text": "Q: Global var vs Shared Instance swift What is the difference between global variable and shared instance in Swift? what are their respective field of use? Could anyone clarify their concept based upon Swift.\n\nA: A global variable is a variable that is declared at the top level in a file. So if we had a class called Bar, you could store a reference to an instance of Bar in a global variable like this:\nvar bar = Bar()\n\nYou would then be able to access the instance from anywhere, like this:\nbar\nbar.foo()\n\nA shared instance, or singleton, looks like this:\nclass Bar {\n    static var shared = Bar()\n    private init() {}\n    func foo() {}\n}\n\nThen you can access the shared instance, still from anywhere in the module, like this:\nBar.shared\nBar.shared.foo()\n\nHowever, one of the most important differences between the two (apart from the fact that global variables are just generally discouraged) is that the singleton pattern restricts you from creating other instances of Bar. In the first example, you could just create more global variables:\nvar bar2 = Bar()\nvar bar3 = Bar()\n\nHowever, using a singleton (shared instance), the initialiser is private, so trying to do this...\nvar baaar = Bar()\n\n...results in this:\n\n'Bar' initializer is inaccessible due to 'private' protection level\n\nThat's a good thing, because the point of a singleton is that there is a single shared instance. Now the only way you can access an instance of Bar is through Bar.shared. It's important to remember to add the private init() in the class, and not add any other initialisers, though, or that won't any longer be enforced.\nIf you want more information about this, there's a great article by KrakenDev here.\n\nA: Singleton (sharing instance)\nEnsure that only one instance of a singleton object is created & It's provide a globally accessible through shared instance of an object that could be shared even across an app.\nThe dispatch_once function, which executes a block once and only once for the lifetime of an app.\nGlobal variable\nApple documentation says Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function, method, closure, or type context.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44939952", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

{"text": "Q: What really happens internally when an update happens on a record with indexed column in sql server I know that when a table has indexed column(s), sql server duplicates the data of these columns so that it can be accessed fast without looking through every record. And if the index is covered with other columns then all these included columns are also stored along with the indexed columns. \nSo, I am assuming when an update happens on any of the indexed columns or included columns then it is obvious that the update should happen in both the actual record location and the index location. This point looks interesting to me because if a table is expected to have more updates than searches, then wouldn't it be overhead to have the index? I wanted to confirm on this and also would like to know the internals on what actually happens behind the screen when a update happens.\n\nA: Yes, you have it correct.  There is a trade-off when adding indexes.  They have the potential to make selects faster, but they will make updates/inserts/deletes slower.\n\nA: When you design an index, consider the following database guidelines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Large numbers of indexes on a table affect the performance of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE statements because all indexes must be adjusted appropriately as data in the table changes. For example, if a column is used in several indexes and you execute an UPDATE statement that modifies that column's data, each index that contains that column must be updated as well as the column in the underlying base table (heap or clustered index).\n\n*Avoid over-indexing heavily updated tables and keep indexes narrow, that is, with as few columns as possible.\n\n*Use many indexes to improve query performance on tables with low update requirements, but large volumes of data. Large numbers of indexes can help the performance of queries that do not modify data, such as SELECT statements, because the query optimizer has more indexes to choose from to determine the fastest access method.\n\n*Indexing small tables may not be optimal because it can take the query optimizer longer to traverse the index searching for data than to perform a simple table scan. Therefore, indexes on small tables might never be used, but must still be maintained as data in the table changes.\n\n\nFor more information have a look at the below link:-\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj835095(v=sql.110).aspx\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23999689", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Zoomable fullscreen image in portrait and landscape mode I am a beginner at programming. I have an app where you can tap into any of the images that are on display to show that image in full-screen mode and can pinch to zoom. The issue I am having is that if you rotate the phone then the image is only half visible.\nI'm using a scroll view to achieve the zoom functionality as that seems to be the consensus of the best way to do it.\nIt works perfectly in portrait mode, or if I enter the fullscreen image while the app is already in landscape orientation, but If I go into the landscape while in the fullscreen image that's where it goes wrong. Here is the code:\nclass PictureDetailViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {\n\n@IBOutlet weak var scrollView: UIScrollView!\nvar routeData = IndividualRoute(numberOfRoute: UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: \"currentRoute\"))\n\nvar detailPicture = UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: \"segueFromDetailvc\")\n\nvar detailImage = UIImageView()\n\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n\n    routeData.routesValues()\n    scrollView.delegate = self\n    selectImage()\n    scrollView.frame = UIScreen.main.bounds\n    scrollView.addSubview(detailImage)\n    scrollViewContents()\n    setupConstraints()\n    let scrollViewFrame = scrollView.frame\n    let scaleWidth = scrollViewFrame.size.width / scrollView.contentSize.width\n    let scaleHieght = scrollViewFrame.size.height / scrollView.contentSize.height\n    let minScale = min(scaleHieght, scaleWidth)\n    scrollView.minimumZoomScale = minScale\n    scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 1\n    scrollView.zoomScale = minScale\n    let tap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dismissFullscreen))\n    tap.numberOfTapsRequired = 2\n    view.addGestureRecognizer(tap)\n\n}\n\n//****************************************\n\n//Image Setup\n\nfunc setupConstraints() {\n\n    scrollView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n\n    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n        scrollView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),\n        scrollView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),\n        scrollView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),\n        scrollView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor),\n        scrollView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),\n        scrollView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)])\n\n    scrollView.contentSize = (detailImage.image?.size)!\n\n\n}\n\nfunc selectImage() {\n    if !detailPicture {\n        let foo = \"\\(routeData.achievements[UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: \"currentAchievement\")])\"\n        detailImage.image = UIImage(named: \"\\(foo.folding(options: .diacriticInsensitive, locale: nil)) 0\")\n    } else {\n        let foo = \"\\(routeData.achievements[0])\"\n        detailImage.image = UIImage(named: \"\\(foo.folding(options: .diacriticInsensitive, locale: nil)) 0\")\n        print(\"\\(foo.folding(options: .diacriticInsensitive, locale: nil)) 0\")\n    }\n\n    guard let width = detailImage.image?.size.width else {\n        return\n    }\n    guard let height = detailImage.image?.size.height else {\n        return\n    }\n\n    let frame: CGRect = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: width, height: height)\n    detailImage.frame = frame\n    detailImage.isUserInteractionEnabled = true\n\n}\n\n//**************************************\n\n//Scrollview setup\n\n\n@objc func dismissFullscreen(){\n    scrollView.setZoomScale(1, animated: true)\n}\n\nfunc scrollViewContents() {\n\n    let boundSize = UIScreen.main.bounds.size\n    var contentFrame = detailImage.frame\n\n    if contentFrame.size.width < boundSize.width {\n        contentFrame.origin.x = (boundSize.width - contentFrame.size.width) / 2\n    } else {\n        contentFrame.origin.x = 0\n    }\n    if contentFrame.size.height < boundSize.height {\n        contentFrame.origin.y = (boundSize.height - contentFrame.size.height) / 2\n    } else {\n        contentFrame.origin.y = 0\n    }\n\n    detailImage.frame = contentFrame\n\n}\n\nfunc scrollViewDidZoom(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {\n    scrollViewContents()\n}\n\nfunc viewForZooming(in scrollView: UIScrollView) -> UIView? {\n\n    return detailImage\n}\n\nSorry for posting so much code but its pretty much all relevant (I think).\nHere are screenshots of the problem:\n\n\n\nA: Okay, I've managed to fix it! Had a little jump around with delight.\nI set up a new function called setupScale() that is called in viewdidload when the view is presented. I also added the viewwillLayoutSubview() override and called the setupScale() function inside it.\nIf looks like this:\nprivate func setupScale() {\n\n    scrollView.frame = UIScreen.main.bounds\n    scrollView.contentSize = (detailImage.image?.size)!\n    scrollViewContents()\n    let scrollViewFrame = scrollView.frame\n    let scaleWidth = scrollViewFrame.size.width / scrollView.contentSize.width\n    let scaleHieght = scrollViewFrame.size.height / scrollView.contentSize.height\n    let minScale = min(scaleHieght, scaleWidth)\n    scrollView.minimumZoomScale = minScale\n    scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 1\n    scrollView.zoomScale = minScale\n}\noverride func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {\n    setupScale()\n}\n\nResults look perfect on my iPad and iPhone 7 in landscape and portrait.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47354076", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: What should be passed as input parameter when using train-test-split function twice in python 3.6 Basically i wanted to split my dataset into training,testing and validation set.

Now to get validation set i am bit confused whether to use splitted testing data or training data as an input parameter of train-test-split in order to get validation set. Give some advise.

A 20% testing dataset is fine. It would be better, if you splitted you training dataset into training and validation (80%/20% is a fair split).

The class I'm trying to reference is:\npublic class Player {\n    private Color shipColor;\n    private String userName;\n    private boolean isFirst;\n    private JButton[][] buttonBoard = new JButton[rows][cols];\n    private final static int rows = 10;\n    private final static int cols = 10;\n\n    public Player(String name){\n        initComponents();\n    }\n\n    private void initComponents(){\n        for(int i = 0; i <= rows; i++){\n            for(int j = 0; j <= cols; j++){\n                buttonBoard[i][j] = new JButton();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n     public JButton[][] getBoard(){\n         return buttonBoard;\n     } \n}\n\nAnd the code I want to use the object in is:\npublic class BattleshipUI extends JFrame {\n    private JMenuBar menuBar;    \n    private JMenu gameMenu;\n    private JMenu optionMenu;\n    private JMenuItem playerPlayer;\n    private JMenuItem playerComputer;\n    private JMenuItem computerComputer; \n    private JMenuItem exit; \n    private JMenuItem game;\n    private JMenuItem player;\n    private JButton deploy;\n    private JPanel shipLayoutPanel;\n    private JPanel playerOnePanel;\n    private JComboBox shipCb;\n    private JComboBox directionCb;\n    // Data arrays for various components on the UI\n    private String[] rowLetters = {\" \",\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"G\",\"H\",\"I\",\"J\"};\n    private String[] columnNumbers = {\" \",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\"};\n    private String[] ships = {\"Carrier\",\"Battleship\",\"Submarine\",\"Destroyer\", \"Patrol Boat\"};\n    private String[] direction = {\"Horizontal\",\"Vertical\"};\n    private static final int PLAYER_ONE = 0;\n    private static final int PLAYER_TWO = 1;\n    private Player playerOne;\n    private Player playerTwo;\n    private Player[] players = new Player[2];\n    private Color[] color = {Color.cyan, Color.green, Color.yellow, Color.magenta, Color.pink, Color.red, Color.white};\n\n    public BattleshipUI(){\n        initComponents();\n        initObjects();\n    }\n\n    public BattleshipUI getThisParent(){\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    private void initObjects(){\n        playerOne = new Player(\"Player One\");\n        playerTwo = new Player(\"Player Two\");\n        players[1] = playerOne;\n        players[2] = playerTwo;\n    }\n\n    private void initComponents(){\n        this.setTitle(\"Battleship\");\n        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        this.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500,500));\n        this.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(500,500));\n\n        menuBar = new JMenuBar();\n        gameMenu = new JMenu(\"Game\");\n        optionMenu = new JMenu(\"Option\");\n        menuBar.add(gameMenu);\n        menuBar.add(optionMenu);\n\n        playerPlayer = new JMenuItem(\"Player vs. Player\");\n        playerComputer = new JMenuItem(\"Player vs. Computer\");\n        computerComputer = new JMenuItem(\"Computer vs. Computer\");\n        exit = new JMenuItem(\"Exit\");\n        gameMenu.add(playerPlayer);\n        gameMenu.add(playerComputer);\n        gameMenu.add(computerComputer);\n        gameMenu.add(exit);\n        playerPlayer.setEnabled(false);\n        computerComputer.setEnabled(false);\n\n        game = new JMenuItem(\"Game Options\");\n        player = new JMenuItem(\"Player Options\");\n        optionMenu.add(game);\n        optionMenu.add(player);\n\n        shipLayoutPanel = new JPanel();\n        shipLayoutPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder(\"Select Ship and Direction\"));\n\n        shipCb = new JComboBox(ships);\n        directionCb = new JComboBox(direction);\n        deploy = new JButton(\"DEPLOY\");\n        deploy.setEnabled(false);\n\n        shipLayoutPanel.add(shipCb);\n        shipLayoutPanel.add(directionCb);\n        shipLayoutPanel.add(deploy);  \n\n        playerOnePanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(11,11));\n        playerOnePanel.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(400,400));\n        playerOnePanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(400,400));\n        playerOnePanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder(\"Player  One\"));\n\n        for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){\n            for(int j = 0; j <= 10; j++){\n               playerOnePanel.add(playerOne.getBoard()); \n             }\n        }   \n\n        this.setJMenuBar(menuBar);\n        this.add(shipLayoutPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);\n        this.add(playerOnePanel, BorderLayout.WEST);\n        this.setVisible(true);\n    }\n}\n\nIs there a way to do this?

I think this will not work (please correct me if i am wrong). You have to do this Button by Button:\nJButton[][] board = playerOne.getBoard();\nfor(int i=0;i<rowSize;i++){\n   for(int j=0;j<columnSize;j++){\n       playerOnePanel.add(board[i][j]);\n   }\n}\n\nNotice: Obviously you have to get somehow the row size and column size and declare as a variable as here as rowSize and columnSize.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42011144", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Multipeer Connectivity Session in iOS7 I've looked into Apple's documentation but is still uncleared about one thing, the session.\n\n\n*\n\n*When - (void)advertiser:(MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser *)advertiser didReceiveInvitationFromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID withContext:(NSData *)context invitationHandler:(void (^)(BOOL, MCSession *))invitationHandler is called, we need to pass in a session to the invitationHandler. What will happen to this session?\nWhen A invites B to join a session that A created, does B provide a new session to A as well? What is inside B's session? Is it just A alone or does it include all the peers that are currently in A's session? Should B keep track of the session that's been used to accept A's invitation?\nInside this article, http://nshipster.com/multipeer-connectivity/, the tutorial creates a new session on the fly and uses it to accept the invitation, wouldn't you lose the session once the function is ended; thus losing information to connected peers?\n\n*Assuming that B, C and D are all invited by A, and now B wants to send something to C. Is it required that B needs to send the information to A first or can B send the information directly to C?\n\n*According to the Apple's documentation, a single session can only hold no more than 8 peers. Is it possible to make an array of sessions so that you can invite more than 8 people to join your device? If that is the case, does client also need to respond with an array so that it can carry more than 8 peers in its list?\n\n*Assuming A and B are now connected, and A now invites C to join. How does B know that C is now in the session?\nThank you for reading such a long post.\n\nA: There's not much in the way of documentation on Multipeer Connectivity, so these answers are based on my own experiments:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are lots of questions inside this one question, but in a nutshell A's session(s) manage invitations that A has sent or accepted. So if B invites and A accepts, the session that A passes when accepting will then be used in the MCSessionDelegate session: peer: didChangeState: callback to say whether the connection happened. At this point the connectedPeers property of A's session will contain B (if the connection succeeded). The session that B used to send the invitation will also get the same callback once A accepts, and will contain A in connectedPeers. Neither A nor B will have any information on the other's session that managed this connection between them. And yes, if you want to send any data to the newly connected peer, you need to keep a reference to the session that handled the connection. I've yet to see any real advantage in creating a new session for each invitation.\n\n*Based on the above, B has no information on who A is connected to. So if A is connected to B,C and D, the only peer B knows about is the peer that it connected to - A. What Multipeer Connectivity offers here is the ability for B to discover C or D via A. So if the A-B connection was made over WiFi, and A-C over Bluetooth, but B does not have Bluetooth enabled, and C is on a different WiFi network to B, B and C can still discover each other through A.

{"text": "Q: OpenGL orientation. (Identity rotation looking in negative z) I'm implementing a renderer that handles every translation- / view- / model- / projection-matrix (I don't use glRotate / glTranslate etc.).\nI have placed several blue objects along the positive z-axis and some red objects on the positive x-axis (So I should be able to see the red objects to my left and the blue ones straight ahead using identity rotation on my camera). It is right-hand-orientation, right?\nThe problem is that I have to turn 180 deg around the y-axis to see my objects. It appears as the identity rotation is looking in -z. \nI'm constructing my View matrix by taking the inverse of the cameras matrix [Rot Tr] and then I put it in a array column-wise and pass it to my shader.\nFor the objects (World matrix) I just pass the matrix [Rot Tr] column-wise to the shader. Should I negate the translation? \nThe projection matrix is for now constructed in the vertex shader as I am working my way through. As you can se below I'm doing \nposition = proj*view*model*gl_Vertex;\n\nAt the moment I use gl_Vertex (I use glutSolidCube after loading identity matrix as my scene objects).\nuniform mat4 view;\nuniform mat4 model;\n\nvarying vec4 pos;\n\nvoid main()\n{   \n\npos = gl_Vertex;\n\n\nfloat aspect = 1.0;\nfloat fovy = 1.5;\nfloat f = 1.0 / tan(fovy * 0.5);\nfloat near = 1.0;\nfloat far = 100.0;\nfloat tt = 1.0 / (near - far);\n\nmat4 proj = mat4(f/aspect, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n        0.0, f, 0.0, 0.0,\n        0.0, 0.0, (near+far)*tt, -1.0,\n        0.0, 0.0, 2.0*near*far*tt, 0.0);\n\ngl_Position = proj * view * model * pos;\n}\n\nIn my fragment shader I set the color = pos so that I can see the color of the axis and the colors appears correct. I think the objects are correctly placed in the scene but with Identity matrix as rotation I'm still looking the opposite way.\nWhat could I have missed? Am I passing the correct matrices in a correct manner?\n\nA: A right-handed coordinate system always looks down the -Z axis. If +X goes right, and +Y goes up (which is how all of OpenGL works), and the view is aligned to the Z axis, then +Z must go towards the viewer. If the view was looking down the +Z axis, then the space would be left-handed.\n\nA: \nThe problem is that I have to turn 180 deg around the y-axis to see my objects. It appears as the identity rotation is looking in -z.\n\nYes it is. The coordinate systems provided yb OpenGL in form for glOrtho and glFrustum are right handed (take your right hand, let the thumb towards the right, the index finger up, then the index finger will point toward you). If you modeled your matrix calculations along those, then you'll get a right handed system as well.\n\nA: Alright completely rewrote this last night and I hope you find it useful if you haven't already came up with your own solutions or someone else who comes along with a similar question.\nBy default your forward vector looks down the -Z, right vector looks down the +X, and up vector looks down the +Y.\nWhen you decide to construct your world it really doesn't matter where you look if you have a 128x128 X,Z world and you are positioned in the middle at 64x64 how would any player know they are rotated 0 degrees or 180 degrees. They simply would not.\nNow you mentioned you dislike the glRotatef and glTranslatef. I as well will not use methods that handle the vector and matrix math. Firstly I use a way where I keep track of the Forward, Up, and Right Vectors. So imagine yourself spinning around in a circle this is you rotating your forward vector. So when a player wants to let's say Run Straight ahead. you will move them along the X,Z of your Forward vector, but let's say they also want to strafe to the right. Well you will still move them along the forward vector, but imagine 90 degrees taken off the forward vector. So if we are facing 45 degrees we are pointing to the -Z and -X quadrant. So strafing will move us in the -Z and +X quadrant. To do this you simple do negate the sin value. Examples of both below, but this can be done differently the below is rough example to better explain the above.\nPosition.X -= Forward.X; //Run Forward.\nPosition.Z -= Forward.Z;\n\nPosition.X += Forward.Z; //Run Backwards.\nPosition.Z += Forward.Z \n\nPosition.X += Forward.X; //Strafe Right.\nPosition.Z -= Forward.Z;\n\nPosition.X -= Forward.X; //Strafe Left.\nPosition.Z += Forward.Z;\n\nBelow is how I initialize my view matrix. These are to only be performed one time do not put this in any looping code.\nglMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);\n\nview_matrix[4] =  0.0f; //UNUSED.\n\nview_matrix[3] =  0.0F; //UNUSED. \nview_matrix[7] =  0.0F; //UNUSED. \nview_matrix[11] = 0.0F; //UNUSED. \nview_matrix[15] = 1.0F; //UNUSED.\n\nupdate_view();\nglLoadMatrix(view_matrix);\n\nThen this is the update_view() method. This is to only to be called during a change in the view matrix.\npublic void update_view()\n{\n    view_matrix[0] =  Forward[0];\n    view_matrix[1] =  Up[1] *  Forward[1];\n    view_matrix[2] =  Up[0] * -Forward[1];\n\n    view_matrix[5] =  Up[0];\n    view_matrix[6] =  Up[1];\n\n    view_matrix[8] =  Forward[1];\n    view_matrix[9] =  Up[1] * -Forward[0];\n    view_matrix[10] = Up[0] *  Forward[0];\n}\n\nThe Position vectors are matricies [12], [13], and [14] and are negated. You can choose to store these or just use matrix[12], [13], [14] as the vector for position.\nview_matrix[12] =  -Position.x;\nview_matrix[13] =  -Position.y;\nview_matrix[14] =  -Position.z;\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9448885", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: Access to previous steep Html I am learning Elm and I seems that you make a new VirtualDOM every view \"frame\".\nview : Model -> Html Msg\n\nThere is no reference to the previous generated Html value, so there is no option to update it (in a functional way). You must rebuild it from scratch. This is highly inefficient.\nHow can you reuse the old frame and only update changed nodes (and their ancestors)?\nEDIT\nAs an answers points, Elm have Html.Lazy. With it and the clever runtime you can avoid repeating most of the work and data allocation (useless garbage collector pressure is a bad thing), but at the expenses of adding a lot of cognitive load on the programmer.\nReasoning about strictness/laziness on the term level (instead of on the type level) is error prone (see Haskell and seq).\nThe perfect solution would be a view function with this signature:\nview : Model -> Html Msg -> Html Msg\n\nThis way you have access to the previous frame VirtualDOM and you can share as much of it with the new frame data structure as you want.\nIs this option available? If not, why not?\n\nA: As you know, Elm uses a \"virtual DOM\". Your program outputs lightweight objects that describe the DOM structure you want, and the virtual DOM implementation \"diffs\" the current and new structure, adding, modifying, and removing elements/attributes/properties as required.\nOf course, there is a small performance penalty to using a virtual DOM over directly manipulating the DOM, but the difference doesn't matter in most web applications. If you find that your application has poor performance in the view function, there are several ways to improve performance, such as Html.Lazy\nMany other popular libraries use a virtual DOM, such as React, Angular, and Vue. Usually, it's easier to render your application with a virtual DOM (rather than \"manually\" manipulating the DOM), so many of the popular frameworks implement one.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51014268", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: How to simply nested ternary logic in react while rendering different component I have the following logic inside a react component where, I am rendering different component based on the boolean values. This peace of code is very difficult to understand. Are there anyways, I can simply that logic:\n      {isEnabled ? (\n      <>\n        {!loading ? (\n          <>\n            {items.length === 0 ? (\n              <>\n                <ComponentOne/>\n                <Container>\n                  <img src={Image} alt=\"Image\" />\n                </Container>\n              </>\n            ) : (\n              <ComponentTwo/>\n            )}\n          </>\n        ) : (\n          <div>\n            <LoadingComponent/>\n          </div>\n        )}\n      </>\n    ) : (\n      <ComponentThree/>\n    )}\n\n\nA: I'd probably split it up into seperate components and pass parameters down the component tree for example\n{isEnabled ? <IsLoadingComponent loading={loading} items={items}> : <ComponentThree/>}\n\n\nA: You might find it useful to split the component up into a \"Loading\" version and a \"Loaded\" version so you don't have to handle both states in the same component. Then the component basically just renders the \"Loading\" or \"Loaded\" version depending on the flag.\nBut even without that, you can at least make that easier to debug by using if/else if etc. and assigning to a temporary variable:\nlet comp;\nif (isEnabled) {\n    if (loading) {\n        comp = <div>\n            <LoadingComponent/>\n        </div>;\n    } else if (items.length === 0) {\n        comp = <>\n            <ComponentOne/>\n            <Container>\n                <img src={Image} alt=\"Image\" />\n            </Container>\n        </>;\n    } else {\n        comp = <ComponentTwo />;\n    }\n} else {\n    comp = <ComponentThree />;\n}\n\nThen just\n{comp}\n\nwhere that nested conditional was.\n\nA: I think you are making a simple thing very complicated. What we can do instead is that make use of \"&&\".\n  { isEnabled && loading && <LoaderComponent /> }\n   {isEnabled && !items.length  &&\n     <>\n     <ComponentOne/>\n     <Container>\n        <img src={Image} alt=\"Image\" />\n     </Container>\n  </>\n}\n{isEnabled && items.length && <ComponentTwo/>}\n{!isEnabled && <ComponentThree />}\n\n\nA: Though I want to support the argument the others made (split into multiple components), you can already achieve a bit more readability by dropping unnecessary fragments (<></>) and/or parenthesis and by using \"better\"(opinion) indentation.\nreturn (\n  isEnabled\n    ? loading\n      ? <div><LoadingComponent/></div>\n      : items.length === 0\n        ? <> {/* this is the only place a fragment is actually needed */}\n          <ComponentOne/>\n          <Container>\n            <img src={Image} alt=\"Image\"/>\n          </Container>\n        </>\n        : <ComponentTwo/>\n    : <ComponentThree/>\n);\n\n\nAlternatively, early returns do help a lot with readability. For example:\nconst SomeComponent = () => {\n  // ...snip...\n\n  if (!isEnabled) {\n    return <ComponentThree/>;\n  }\n\n  if (loading) {\n    return <div><LoadingComponent/></div>;\n  }\n\n  if (items.length > 0) {\n    return <ComponentThree/>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ComponentOne/>\n      <Container>\n        <img src={Image} alt=\"Image\"/>\n      </Container>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69752160", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

The app intended to be used on desktops only (no mobile).\n\nA: Yes, it will solve browser compatibility issues, and could work on both Mac OS and Windows with the very same code.\nThe only drawback is that, the first time your user connect to your application, he will need to download the Silverlight plugin.\nAwesome you would say? Well, unfortunately some people that probably never try to do something like image processing or advanced line of business application in a browser decide that plugins are not so cool and that you would be able to do the same thing with the magic power of HTML5.\nWe are still waiting to have the same possibility in HTML5 that we have in Silverlight or Flash, but plugins are already dead. At least as long as no big compay want to push them again.\nSo, my advice would be: don't start a project in Silverlight. You will have problems, even if you do not target mobile. For example it becomes harder and harder to find compatible good tools (like ReSharper, NCrunch, or even just a decent unit testing library). And in further release of Windows and Mac OS, it will probably not be supported at all (IE for Windows RT already does not support Silverlight).\nSorry man, Silverlight is dead, you arrive after the battle.\n\nA: If your developing your application for an Intranet, I would say Silverlight is an excellent choice.\nIf you are developing for the Internet, use an HTML based language\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25079470", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I use a bitmask? How do I use it in C++? When is it useful to use?\nWhat would be an example of a problem where a bitmask is used to see how it actually works?\n\nA: Let's say I have 32-bit ARGB value with 8-bits per channel. I want to replace the alpha component with another alpha value, such as 0x45\nunsigned long alpha = 0x45\nunsigned long pixel = 0x12345678;\npixel = ((pixel & 0x00FFFFFF) | (alpha << 24));\n\nThe mask turns the top 8 bits to 0, where the old alpha value was. The alpha value is shifted up to the final bit positions it will take, then it is OR-ed into the masked pixel value. The final result is 0x45345678 which is stored into pixel.\n\nA: Bitmasks are used when you want to encode multiple layers of information in a single number.\nSo (assuming unix file permissions) if you want to store 3 levels of access restriction (read, write, execute) you could check for each level by checking the corresponding bit.\nrwx\n---\n110\n\n110 in base 2 translates to 6 in base 10.\nSo you can easily check if someone is allowed to e.g. read the file by and'ing the permission field with the wanted permission.\nPseudocode:\nPERM_READ = 4\nPERM_WRITE = 2\nPERM_EXEC = 1\n\nuser_permissions = 6\n\nif ((user_permissions & PERM_READ) == PERM_READ) then\n  // this will be reached, as 6 & 4 is true\nfi\n\nYou need a working understanding of binary representation of numbers and logical operators to understand bit fields.\n\nA: Bit masking is \"useful\" to use when you want to store (and subsequently extract) different data within a single data value.\nAn example application I've used before is imagine you were storing colour RGB values in a 16 bit value. So something that looks like this:\nRRRR RGGG GGGB BBBB\n\nYou could then use bit masking to retrieve the colour components as follows:\n  const unsigned short redMask   = 0xF800;\n  const unsigned short greenMask = 0x07E0;\n  const unsigned short blueMask  = 0x001F;\n\n  unsigned short lightGray = 0x7BEF;\n\n  unsigned short redComponent   = (lightGray & redMask) >> 11;\n  unsigned short greenComponent = (lightGray & greenMask) >> 5;\n  unsigned short blueComponent =  (lightGray & blueMask);\n\n\nA: Briefly, a bitmask helps to manipulate the position of multiple values. There is a good example here;\nBitflags are a method of storing multiple values, which are not mutually exclusive, in one variable. You've probably seen them before. Each flag is a bit position which can be set on or off. You then have a bunch of bitmasks #defined for each bit position so you can easily manipulate it:\n    #define LOG_ERRORS            1  // 2^0, bit 0\n    #define LOG_WARNINGS          2  // 2^1, bit 1\n    #define LOG_NOTICES           4  // 2^2, bit 2\n    #define LOG_INCOMING          8  // 2^3, bit 3\n    #define LOG_OUTGOING         16  // 2^4, bit 4\n    #define LOG_LOOPBACK         32  // and so on...\n\n// Only 6 flags/bits used, so a char is fine\nunsigned char flags;\n\n// Initialising the flags,\n// Note that assigning a value will clobber any other flags, so you\n// it should generally only use the = operator when initialising variables.\nflags = LOG_ERRORS;\n// Sets to 1 i.e. bit 0\n\n// Initialising to multiple values with OR (|)\nflags = LOG_ERRORS | LOG_WARNINGS | LOG_INCOMING;\n// sets to 1 + 2 + 8 i.e. bits 0, 1 and 3\n\n// Setting one flag on, leaving the rest untouched\n// OR bitmask with the current value\nflags |= LOG_INCOMING;\n\n// Testing for a flag\n// AND with the bitmask before testing with ==\nif ((flags & LOG_WARNINGS) == LOG_WARNINGS)\n   ...\n\n// Testing for multiple flags\n// As above, OR the bitmasks\nif ((flags & (LOG_INCOMING | LOG_OUTGOING))\n         == (LOG_INCOMING | LOG_OUTGOING))\n   ...\n\n// Removing a flag, leaving the rest untouched\n// AND with the inverse (NOT) of the bitmask\nflags &= ~LOG_OUTGOING;\n\n// Toggling a flag, leaving the rest untouched\nflags ^= LOG_LOOPBACK;\n\n**\n\n\nWARNING: DO NOT use the equality operator (i.e. bitflags == bitmask)\nfor testing if a flag is set - that expression will only be true if\nthat flag is set and all others are unset.

I don't mind some trial and error, but don't want to waste the time if it isn't possible\nI want to have an animated gif as an activity indicator (it is a logo).\nI have it working in a WebView - is it possible, in Xamarin,Forms to have this appear as an overlay while waiting on long running methods?\nFor example. if  user clicks on a button, the app gets some info from a webservice then displays in a page. While waiting I would like to show the webview (or any other way to show an animagted gif).\nSo I am not asking for the code, but just if it is posible.\nThanks in advance \n\nA: I was able to work this out\nWith the animated(loading) gif running in the WebView page I called a couple of async methods using following      \nawait Task.WhenAll(method1(), method2());\nawait Navigate.PushAsync(new NextPage(var1, var2));\n\nThe laoding gif (which is an animated logo) runs until the tasks are complete then navigates to the next page\n\nA: Using an ImageView apparently this doesn't look like its possible to playback animated Gif's as can be seen here http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/17448/animated-gif-in-image-view.\nSo i very much doubt the ActivityIndicator would, if it could.  In the ActivityIndicator I can't see any functionality to change the content of the what is shown when it is busy.\nYou could always create your own animated image view by creating a custom renderer instead however.  It isn't particularly hard to cycle images at pre-determined gaps if you have a list of the images split up.\n\nA: GIF images can be used in Xamarin forms to show custom activity indicator, since in Xamarin forms it is not possible to show GIF images directly web-view must be used. For android image must be placed inside assets folder and Build Action must be set to AndroidAsset. For iOS image must be placed inside resources and Build Action must be set to BundleResource. AbsoluteLayout can used for placing the image to center, IsBusy property of mvvm helpers nuget can used for controlling the visibility of the activity indicator. Dependency service must used for getting the image path. You can check this https://github.com/LeslieCorrea/Xamarin-Forms-Custom-Activity-Indicator for example.\n\nA: Xamarin.Forms now supports .GIF, from version 4.4-pre3 and up on iOS, Android and UWP. Before using, first add the .GIF to the platforms projects, or as an embedded resource in the shared project and then use it like a regular image. The API on the Image control has been extended with the IsAnimationPlaying bindable property.\nFor e.g., loader.gif is added in all platform projects, then below code make it animating.\n<Image Source=\"loader\" IsAnimationPlaying=\"True\" WidthRequest=\"36\" HorizontalOptions=\"CenterAndExpand\" VerticalOptions=\"CenterAndExpand\" />\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25808010", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

This runs without error, but doesn't seem to ever trigger the detection event, making me think that perhaps I've missed something.\nCould anyone walk me through the process?

{"text": "Q: Why push notification directed to specific iOS device from Web API through Firebase FCM does not arrive? I'm working with a remote web API developer, currently we're working to send push message from the server to iOS and Android device. We send our device token via OAuth API. (For iOS, device token is gotten from registering remote service with APNS service at AppDelegate launch). The weird thing is, Android can get the push notification, but iOS devices don't. But when I tried using the Firebase console -> grow -> notification -> New Message -> and target all the iOS device, all the iOS device registered to the push notification receive the push notification. Can you help me point out where the problem is? The web server is using nodeJs.\nThings I have done, which I did according to this tutorial:\n\n\n*\n\n*create new apps in Firebase project.\n\n*supply the same product bundle id to the app.\n\n*import google plist to the Xcode project.\n\n*supply development and production certificate .p12 to the app.\n\n*install Firebase/Core and Firebase/Messaging through Cocoapods.\n\n*use this code to register for remote notification (have tried both in target deployment iOS version 9.0 and 10.0, both yields the same result):\n\n\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    // Override point for customization after application launch.\n\n    if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {\n        // For iOS 10 display notification (sent via APNS)\n        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self\n        let authOptions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .badge, .sound]\n        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(\n            options: authOptions,\n            completionHandler: {_, _ in })\n        // For iOS 10 data message (sent via FCM\n        Messaging.messaging().delegate = self\n    } else {\n        let settings: UIUserNotificationSettings =\n            UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.alert, .badge, .sound], categories: nil)\n        application.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)\n    }\n\n    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()\n\n    FirebaseApp.configure()\n\n    return true\n}\n\nFrom all this preparation, if I run the app in real iOS device, and then lock it, any message I broadcast to iOS device in the Firebase iOS app will shown in the lock screen notification. But not message from the web API that's directed toward the account logged in the app (which is directed to all the android and iOS device that logged in using that account -- it's shown on the android devices, but not on iOS devices).\nI'm new to FCM. I usually use APNS. I probably don't know much about the terms to fix the server side as I don't understand nodeJs much, so if you have some suggestion about the server side, please be elaborate, so I can discuss it with the web API dev.

See https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.task for more information.\n\nA: If you run grunt in your terminal it is going to search for a \"default\" task, so you have to register a task to be executed with Grunt defining it with the grunt.registerTask method, with a first parameter which is the name of your task, and a second parameter which is an array of subtasks that it will run.\nIn your case, the code could be something like that:\n...\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-execute');\ngrunt.registerTask(\"default\", [\"execute\", \"watch\"]);\n...\n\nIn this way the \"default\" task will run rispectively the \"execute\" and the \"watch\" commands.\nHowever here you can find the documentation to create tasks with Grunt.\nHope it was helpful.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49379258", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

As I see it, maybe this would work If I could pass a reference of sheet2 to OpenXmlWriter:\nint row_number = 0;\n\nusing (var Excel_doc = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(file_path, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook))\n{\n      var workbookPart = Excel_doc.AddWorkbookPart();\n\n      Excel_doc.WorkbookPart.Workbook = new Workbook\n      {\n             Sheets = new Sheets()\n      };\n\n      var sheetPart = Excel_doc.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();\n\n      //Add sheet\n      Sheets sheets = Excel_doc.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>();\n      string relationshipId = Excel_doc.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(sheetPart);\n\n      uint sheetId = 1;\n      if (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() > 0)\n      {\n         sheetId = sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Select(s => s.SheetId.Value).Max() + 1;\n      }\n\n      Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = \"Sheet \" + sheetId };\n      sheets.Append(sheet);\n\n      using (var XML_write = OpenXmlWriter.Create(sheetPart))\n      {\n          XML_write.WriteStartElement(new Worksheet()); \n          XML_write.WriteStartElement(new SheetData());\n\n          //Writing data using DataReader...\n          using (OracleDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())\n          {\n              while (reader.Read())\n              {\n                 XML_write.WriteStartElement(new Row());\n\n                 for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)\n                 {\n                      row_number++;\n                 }\n                 XML_write.WriteEndElement(); //End of row\n\n                //If 1 million row exceeded then proceed writing to next sheet - here is where I'm stucked\n                if (row_number>1000000)\n                {\n                    sheetId +=1;   \n                    Sheet sheet1 = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = \"List \" + sheetId };\n                    sheets.Append(sheet1);\n\n                    XML_write.WriteEndElement(); \n                    XML_write.WriteEndElement(); \n                    XML_write.WriteStartElement(new Worksheet()); \n                    XML_write.WriteStartElement(new SheetData());\n                    row_number=0;\n                 }\n              }\n          }\n          XML_write.WriteEndElement(); \n          XML_write.WriteEndElement(); \n          XML_write.Close();\n      }\n}     \n\nWhile writing .xlsx file this code terminates with an error: \n\nToken StartElement in state EndRootElement would result in an invalid XML document. Make sure that the ConformanceLevel setting is set to ConformanceLevel.Fragment or ConformanceLevel.Auto if you want to write an XML fragment\n\nI would be more than happy If anyone has a solution to this, or a suggestion to make It work.\nP.S.: Something similar already exists in some solutions - e.g. Toad for Oracle, which exports into .xls file on multiple sheets after hitting max 65k rows. So probably It can be done.\n\nA: Seems like you need to swap the order of the loops, basically.

But I want that when the alert is open, in the same time textfield will be selected and keyboard comes(without any touch). how can it posible ? sorry for my bad English.  \n\nA: [myTextField becomeFirstResponder] will probably do what you want.\n\nA: That would be a little tricky to do. The controls in iPhone use the concept of \"first responders\" Any events will be handled by the first responder in the controller. Now, when an alert view is displayed, it becomes the first responder so it can respond to button clicks. When a text field is selected by the user, the keyboard gets the control. So I guess what you want to achieve can be done by making the text field the first responder after showing the alert ([txtField becomeFirstResponder])\nBut I have no idea how the alert view's responses will be handled then. You won't be able to click the OK button on the alert view till the keyboard is dismissed and you resign the first responder of the text field.

The area above the red line is not visible.\n\nA: If I see... you can use ScrollTo method.\nyourLongListMultiSelector.ScrollTo(yourNewInsertedItem);\n\n\nA: To get you going, I tried something but could not get it a 100%\nHere is a working basic page template which in fact does what you require with messages\n<phone:PhoneApplicationPage >\n\n<ScrollViewer x:Name=\"Scroll\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" Height=\"500\" ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=\"Disabled\">\n    <StackPanel VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" >\n        <toolkit:LongListMultiSelector x:Name=\"DataList\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding}\" ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=\"Disabled\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\"\n        VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode=\"Recycling\"></toolkit:LongListMultiSelector>\n    </StackPanel>\n</ScrollViewer>\n\n</phone:PhoneApplicationPage>\n\nThis keeps new messages down, pulling the list up. The scrolling is now disabled. You can easily enclose ScrollViewer in grid and add the button above (like in your picture)\nNow the code that would go into the button click\n    Scroll.VerticalScrollBarVisibility = ScrollBarVisibility.Hidden;\n    Scroll.ScrollToVerticalOffset(DataList.ActualHeight);\n\nUnfortunately this scrolls the list up BUT if you trigger the second line of code again for example via button click, ScrollToVerticalOffset works. So for some reason ScrollToVerticalOffset is not working right away-after changing VerticalScrollBarVisibility. If you can get this last part figured out, I believe your question would be solved\n\nA: The thing that prevents your desired effect is the ListHeader control is at top when you insert item at top.

Several weeks ago I built a calendar that used the standard Oauth 2.0 protocol but this relied sessions stored by a user's we browser. I have one calendar that I want to pass events to from an application I am writing with a basic PHP framework. I'm more concerned with what are the best practices that others are using. Your answer could be simply, don't do it. Thanks alot.\n\nA: try Zend_Gdata_Calendar with this library you are able to insert or get events from any user(with the right username and password obviously) from google calendar and integrate with your own calendar or display it..here a short example:\n    $service = Zend_Gdata_Calendar::AUTH_SERVICE_NAME;\n    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient('gmail@user.com',    'gmailpassword', $service);\n    $service = new Zend_Gdata_Calendar($client);\n\n\n\n    $query = $service->newEventQuery();\n    $query->setUser('default');\n    $query->setVisibility('private');\n\n\n    try {\n         $eventFeed = $service->getCalendarEventFeed($query);\n    } catch (Zend_Gdata_App_Exception $e) {\n        echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n\n\n    echo \"<ul>\";\n    foreach ($eventFeed as $event) {\n     echo \"<li>\" . $event->title . \" (Event ID: \" . $event->id . \")</li>\";\n\n    }\n    echo \"</ul>\";\n\n\n\n    $eventURL = \"http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/default/private/full/Dir0FthEpUbl1cGma1lCalendAr\";\n\n    try {\n        $event = $service->getCalendarEventEntry($eventURL);\n\n        echo 'Evento: ' . $event->getTitle() .'<br>';\n        echo 'detalles: ' . $event->getContent().'<br>';\n        foreach ($event->getWhen() as $dato)\n        {\n            echo 'inicia: ' . substr($dato->startTime, 0,-19) .

{"text": "Q: Many aggregate functions in select query I'm not sure what the best way to approach this is so I figured I'd toss it to SO.\nI'm writing a view for an application which will display some grid data based on a few tables in our database.  I know I can do this with aggregate functions in the select portion of the query, but I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way (possibly with sub-selects) or if this will be good enough.\nExample:\nTable A (LineItems)\n--------\nOrderID\nWeight1\nWeight2\nUnitPrice\n\nTable B (Orders)\n--------\nID\n\nQuery example:\nSELECT Orders.ID, SUM(LineItems.Weight1) as W1, SUM(LineItems.Weight2) as W2, ABS(SUM(LineItems.Weight1) - SUM(LineItems.Weight2)), ABS(SUM(LineItems.Weight1) - SUM(LineItems.Weight2)) FROM Orders\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN LineItems ON Orders.ID = OrderLines.OrderID\nWHERE Orders.RecordDeleted <> 'TRUE'\nGROUP BY Orders.ID\n\nTo clarify, this is just a sample.  The select query will include functions for calculating price from the lineitems as well as a few other things that need to be used in aggregate functions (all pretty basic math operations).\n\nA: As long as you are grouping using the same column you should be to go. Unfortunately it is not the case if you want to group on different columns. The counts will be narrowed to the whole list of the GROUP BY, for example if you want to group by OrderLines.ID as well.\nFor a better performance, I would use calculated columns in the Orders table.\nFirst you need to create a user defined function:\nCREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetOrderWeight(@Key int)\nRETURNS int\nAS\nBEGIN\n    RETURN (\n        SELECT SUM(Weight1)\n        FROM LineItems\n        WHERE OrderID = @Key\n    )\nEND\n\nThen add a calculated column to the table:\nALTER TABLE Orders ADD OrderWeight AS dbo.GetOrderWeight(ID)\n\nFollow with the same for other aggregate methods you have. Please be aware that this is a performance killer if used with function that has varchar(max) as input parameter type.\n\nA: This is should be more effective then using subselects.\nJust be sure that you have proper indexes to get the best performance.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20245670", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Standardization before or after categorical encoding? I'm working on a regression algorithm, in this case k-NearestNeighbors to predict a certain price of a product.\nSo I have a Training set which has only one categorical feature with 4 possible values. I've dealt with it using a one-to-k categorical encoding scheme which means now I have 3 more columns in my Pandas DataFrame with a 0/1 depending the value present.\nThe other features in the DataFrame are mostly distances like latitud - longitude for locations and prices, all numerical.\nShould I standardize (Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance) and normalize before or after the categorical encoding?\nI'm thinking it might be benefitial to normalize after encoding so that every feature is to the estimator as important as every other when measuring distances between neighbors but I'm not really sure.\n\nA: Seems like an open problem, thus I'd like to answer even though it's late. I am also unsure how much the similarity between the vectors would be affected, but in my practical experience you should first encode your features and then scale them. I have tried the opposite with scikit learn preprocessing.StandardScaler() and it doesn't work if your feature vectors do not have the same length: scaler.fit(X_train) yields ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. I can see from your description that your data have a fixed number of features, but I think for generalization purposes (maybe you have new features in the future?), it's good to assume that each data instance has a unique feature vector length. For instance, I transform my text documents into word indices with Keras text_to_word_sequence (this gives me the different vector length), then I convert them to one-hot vectors and then I standardize them. I have actually not seen a big improvement with the standardization. I think you should also reconsider which of your features to standardize, as dummies might not need to be standardized. Here it doesn't seem like categorical attributes need any standardization or normalization. K-nearest neighbors is distance-based, thus it can be affected by these preprocessing techniques. I would suggest trying either standardization or normalization and check how different models react with your dataset and task.\n\nA: After. Just imagine that you have not numerical variables in your column but strings. You can't standardize strings - right? :)\nBut given what you wrote about categories. If they are represented with values, I suppose there is some kind of ranking inside. Probably, you can use raw column rather than one-hot-encoded. Just thoughts.\n\nA: You generally want to standardize all your features so it would be done after the encoding (that is assuming that you want to standardize to begin with, considering that there are some machine learning algorithms that do not need features to be standardized to work well).\n\nA: So there is 50/50 voting on whether to standardize data or not.\nI would suggest, given the positive effects in terms of improvement gains no matter how small and no adverse effects, one should do standardization before splitting and training estimator\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47272033", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "8"}}

I don't know the meaning of letting code in TestInner2 can access to the private member of TestInner1.\nI was searched about inner class in google, none of the search results shows that inner class have this feature. I also look up to The Java Language Specification, but it still not mention about that.\n\nA: \"Otherwise, if the member or constructor is declared private, then access is permitted if and only if it occurs within the body of the top level class (\u00a77.6) that encloses the declaration of the member or constructor.\" JLS 6.6.1 In this case, TestOutter is the top-level class, so all private fields inside it are visible.\nBasically, the purpose of declaring a member private is to help ensure correctness by keeping other classes (subclasses or otherwise) from meddling with it. Since a top-level class is the Java compilation unit, the spec assumes that access within the same file has been appropriately managed.\n\nA: This is because the inner class, as a member of the outer class, has access to all the private variables of its outer class.  And since the other inner class is also a member of the outer class, all of its private variables are accessible as well.\nEdit: Think of it like you have a couple of couch cushion forts(inner classes) in a house(outer class), one yours the other your siblings.  Your forts are both in the house so you have access to all the things in your house.

Consider this code:\nvar x = \"tesx\".Remove('x');\n\nIf I run this code, I get this exception:\n\nstartIndex must be less than length of string.\n\nWhy can I pass a char instead of an int to this method?\nWhy don't I get a compilation error?\n\nWhy does the compiler have this behavior?\n\nA: you try to remove 'x' which is a declared as char, x is equal to 120\nThe .Remove only takes 2 parameters of type int the start and (optional) count to remove from the string.\nIf you pass a char, it will be converted to the integer representation. Meaning if you pass 'x' -> 120 is greater than the string's .Length and that's why it will throw this error!\n\nA: Remove takes an int parameter for the index within the string to start removing characters, see msdn. The remove call must automatically convert the char to its ASCII integer index and try to remove the character at that index from the string, it is not trying to remove the character itself.\nIf you just want to remove any cases where x occurs in the string do:  \n\"testx\".Replace(\"x\",string.Empty);\n\nIf you want to remove the first index of x in the string do:\nvar value = \"testx1x2\";\nvar newValue = value.Remove(value.IndexOf('x'), 1);\n\n\nA: Implicit conversion lets you compile this code since char can be converted to int and no explicit conversion is required. This will also compile and the answer will be 600 (120*5) -\n        char c = 'x';\n        int i = c;\n        int j = 5;\n        int answer = i * j;\n\nFrom MSDN, implicit conversion is summarized as below -\n\nAs other's have stated you could use Replace or Remove with valid inputs.\n\nA: There is no overload of Remove that takes a char, so the character is implicitly converted to an int and the Remove method tries to use it as an index into the string, which is way outside the string. That's why you get that runtime error instead of a compile time error saying that the parameter type is wrong.\nTo use Remove to remove part of a string, you first need to find where in the string that part is. Example:\nvar x = \"tesx\";\nvar x = x.Remove(x.IndexOf('x'), 1);\n\nThis will remove the first occurance of 'x' in the string. If there could be more than one occurance, and you want to remove all, using Replace is more efficient:\nvar x = \"tesx\".Replace(\"x\", String.Empty);\n\n\nA: Since you are passing a char in the function and this value is getting converted to int at runtime hence you are getting the runtime error because the value of char at runtime is more than the length of the string.You may try like this:-\nvar x = \"tesx\";\nvar s = x.Remove(x.IndexOf('x'), 1);\n\nor\nvar s = x.Replace(\"x\",string.Empty);\n\n.Remove takes the int as parameter. Remove takes two parameters. The first one is what position in your string you want to start at. (The count starts at zero.) The second parameter is how many characters you want to delete, starting from the position you specified. \nOn a side note:\nFrom MSDN:\n\nThis method(.Remove) does not modify the value of the current instance.\n  Instead, it returns a new string in which the number of characters\n  specified by the count parameter have been removed. The characters are\n  removed at the position specified by startIndex.\n\n\nA: You can use extension methods to create your own methods for already existing classes. Consider following example:\nusing System;\nusing MyExtensions;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApplication\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            const string str1 = \"tesx\";\n            var x = str1.RemoveByChar('x');\n            Console.WriteLine(x);\n            Console.ReadKey();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace MyExtensions\n{\n    public static class StringExtensions\n    {\n        public static string RemoveByChar(this String str, char c)\n        {\n            return str.Remove(str.IndexOf(c), 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19343958", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "59"}}

{"text": "Q: Rendering Divs in an Index action with bootstrap I am building a Ruby on Rails app with a TradingCard model. I have an index action and corresponding view where I am trying to print out each TradingCard object. Here's basically what I've got in my controller, under my index action:\n@trading_cards = TradingCard.all\n\nHere's my issue: I am using bootstrap to help me out with the basic grid-like approach of the styling, as well as its convenience on small mobile screens. I'm using bootstrap to help with the general layout and flow, but I've constructed my own little trading-card-esque container for each TradingCard object; I wrote it with my own CSS. It has no specified height, so it can be as tall as it needs to be to fit in all of the text specific to that individual object. \nOn medium sized screens, I would like for my Index view to simply display three trading cards per row, WHERE EACH ROW ISN'T OBSTRUCTED BY A TRADING CARD FROM THE ROW BELOW IT. This is a problem, because best practice is to simply include the following in your index view, (of course with a _trading_card partial in the view folder):\n<%= render @trading_cards %>\n\nAnd in my _trading_card partial I have something like this: \n<div class=\"col-md-4\">\n<%= trading_card.body %>\n</div>\n\nThe only problem with this approach is that I can't really tell the layout to create a new row every 3 trading cards. Instead, I have to just keep spitting out col-md-4 into one really really long row and as a result, some of the taller trading cards end up squeezing themselves up into the rows above them, and it looks really odd.\nIs there a better way to go about this entire approach? Am I missing something? Or is there a way to specify in my controller that I want to load the objects in bundles of 3 so that I can just write an iteration that creates a new row with every time through the loop?\nAny help is so much appreciated. Sorry if this question was really long. You guys are always so helpful and I really can't thank you all enough.\nThanks in advance for any help!!!!\n\nA: Instead of using render @trading_cards to loop through your TradingCards for you.

{"text": "Q: How to handle database exceptions in .NET? I'm using Oracle through their official managed drivers for .NET (a Nuget package). \nMy application uses the same connection to the DB from the beginning and it's used from several locations to perform queries.\nIn some cases, there may be connection \"hiccups\" that cause exceptions. The problem is that I don't know what's the best strategy to retry to perform a query when this happens.\nIs there a common way to solve this situation? \nThank you.\n\nA: I agree with the comment from Habib.\nThe oracle .NET Package uses connection pooling.  Even if you open up multiple connections, it will manage them accordingly so that you don't have to keep it open.\nThat means that your code can be simplified, into something like this pseudo-code:\nusing(OracleConnection conn = MakeConnection())\n{\n   //do stuff with connection\n\n   //not necessary, but I always manually close connection. Doesn't hurt.\n   conn.Close();\n}\n\nIf you're uncertain of connection issues even in that small of an execution, you can wrap it in a try-catch block like so:\ntry\n{\n   using(OracleConnection conn = MakeConnection())\n   {\n      //do stuff with connection\n\n      //not necessary, but I always manually close connection. Doesn't hurt.\n      conn.Close();\n   }\n}\ncatch(OracleException ex)\n{\n    //handle exception.\n}\n\nOracleException looks to be the main exception with the .NET oracle package.  Please note that there may be others you want to catch more specifically.\n\nA: It would be easier to instantiate the connection on the fly when the query is being made. I don't think a simple try/catch would help you here because even if you reinitialized the connection in the catch block, you would have to somehow re-execute your query. \nI don't recommend this but you could use a Retry class that reinitializes the connection if an exception is caught....\npublic class Retry\n{\n    public static void Do(Action action, TimeSpan retryInterval, int retryCount = 3)\n    {\n        Do<object>(() =>\n        {\n            action();\n            return null;\n        }, \n        retryInterval, retryCount);\n    }\n\n    public static T Do<T>(Func<T> action, TimeSpan retryInterval, int retryCount = 3)\n    {\n        var exceptions = new List<Exception>();\n\n        for (int retry = 0; retry < retryCount; retry++)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                if (retry > 0)\n                    Thread.Sleep(retryInterval);\n                return action();\n            }\n            catch (ConnectionException ex)\n            {\n                // ***Handle the reconnection in here***\n\n                exceptions.Add(ex);\n            }\n        }\n\n        throw new AggregateException(exceptions);\n    }\n}\n\nThen you can call your query like\nRetry.Do(() => MyQueryMethod, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)); \n\nI got the basis for this Retry code from SO a long time ago, don't recall the thread but it isn't my original code. I have used it quite a bit for some things though. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36752117", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: How do I persist a detached object? I have a simple editor UI for performing CRUD on a database table.\nUnder Hibernate 5.1, the process was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a session. Read in data objects. Close session, detaching the objects.\n\n*With the detached objects, populate the UI widgets.\n\n*Allow user to add/edit/remove entries in the UI, modifying the detached objects.\n\n*On a user \"save\" action: Create a new session. Persist new/updated objects with saveOrUpdate(). Close session.\n\n*Repeat as required.\n\n\nHibernate 5.2 strongly recommends moving from the Hibernate-native API to the JPA API. JPA does not allow you to reattach detached objects.\nThere are a couple of workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use unwrap to get the Hibernate session from the JPA EntityManager, and use it to call saveOrUpdate. I don't like this option because it relies on functionality that is not part of the JPA.\n\n*Use JPA merge, which will update the persisted object, although I've got to ensure I don't break any associations. This gives me 2 copies of the same object, one persisted, one detached... which is messy.\n\n*Perform a manual merge operation, copying modified fields from the detached object to the persisted object. This is extra work.\n\n*Keep a single EntityManager instance alive through the whole process. Unfortunately, other threads could perform CRUD operations while this session is still open, taking the persisted context out of sync with the database table. So I'm not a fan of this approach either.\n\n\nIs there any good way to do this, or are these the only options available?\n\nA: \nJPA does not allow you to reattach detached objects.\n\nThe JPA specification defines the merge() operation. The operation seems to be useful to implement the described use case.\nPlease refer to the specification:\n\n3.2.7.1 Merging Detached Entity State\nThe merge operation allows for the propagation of state from detached entities onto persistent entities managed by the entity manager. The semantics of the merge operation applied to an entity X are as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If X is a detached entity, the state of X is copied onto a pre-existing managed entity instance X' of the same identity or a new managed copy X' of X is created.\n  \n*If X is a new entity instance, a new managed entity instance X' is created and the state of X is copied into the new managed entity instance X'.\n  \n*If X is a removed entity instance, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown by the merge operation (or the transaction commit will fail).\n  \n*If X is a managed entity, it is ignored by the merge operation, however, the merge operation is cascaded to entities referenced by relationships from X if these relationships have been annotated with the cascade element value cascade=MERGE or cascade=ALL annotation.\n  \n*For all entities Y referenced by relationships from X having the cascade element value cascade=MERGE or cascade=ALL, Y is merged recursively as Y'. For all such Y referenced by X, X' is set to reference Y'.

This removes the whitespace:\n:%substitute/\\s*\\(!\\+.*$\\)/\\r\\1/\n\nBut it still matches comments at the start of a line, and introduces an additional empty line in front. We can add a lookbehind assertion that the line must not start with a !, but this now gets ugly:\n:%substitute/^\\%(^[^!].*\\)\\@=.*\\zs\\s*\\(!\\+.*$\\)/\\r\\1/\n\nInstead, it's easier to use another Vim command, :global (or its inverted sister :vglobal), to only match lines not starting with !, and then apply the :substitute there:\n:%vglobal/^!/substitute/\\s*\\(!\\+.*$\\)/\\r\\1/\n\nThe final requirement is that exclamation marks within strings should be kept. This would add another regular expression, and integrating it into the overall match would be really hard, and could probably be only done approximately. Fortunately, with syntax highlighting, Vim already knows what is a Fortran string!\nMy PatternsOnText plugin has (among others) a :SubstituteIf / :SubstituteUnless combo that can do substitutions only if a condition is true / false. The library it depends on provides a wrapper around synIdAttr() that makes it easy to define a predicate for Fortran strings:\nfunction! IsFortranString()\n    return ingo#syntaxitem#IsOnSyntax(getpos('.'), '^fortranString')\nendfunction\n\nWe then only need to replace :substitute with :SubstituteUnless + predicate:\n:%vglobal/^!/SubstituteUnless/\\s*\\(!\\+.*$\\)/\\r\\1/ IsFortranString()\n\nThe same can also be achieved without the plugin (using :help sub-replace-special and synstack() / synIdAttr()), but it'd be more complex.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52278484", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

Depending on your needs, this may or may not be a practical solution.\nThe rest of my answer is focused on manipulating the elements after placement.\nDo you need your users to be able to select the location of the placement?  If not, then you can use the NewFamilyInstance method to place the element (there is no preview, and you must provide a location point).\nThis function returns the element that was just placed, so you would be able to modify it after placement.\nYou may be able to use the Selection.PickPoint method to allow the user to pick a point for placement which you can pass to NewFamilyInstance, but I'm not sure how this works with elevations.\nThe alternative is to use a FilteredElementCollector after the element has been placed.  You could use a FamilyInstanceFilter to find all of the instances of the FamilySymbol you are using.\nSince Revit ElementId's increase as new elements are placed (with some exceptions due to worksharing/synchronizing that aren't relevant here), you could retrieve the element with the highest ElementId and safely assume that it's the one you just placed.\nAnother suggestion would be to run the FilteredElementCollector before you place your elements, and then run it again after.  The difference would be the element/s that you just placed.\n\nA: Doesn't the familySymbol object have the get_Parameter()  method? \nI think you can use it to achieve your goal. \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21913344", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

You might need to mark the respective memory segment as \"executable\" which is NOT possible via C runtime, it is only possible using Windows API calls (like VirtualAllocEx) with proper permissions... see for a starting point here and here.\n\nA: I don't believe malloc is part of kernel32.dll. However, if I recall correctly, all malloc implementations eventually drill down to HeapAlloc, which is available in kernel32.dll.\n\nA: \nI want to resolve the addresses of functions like those from the C stdlib\n\nThere's your problem.  You speak as if there's a single C runtime library.  In fact there are many.  Every compiler provides its own, in several different flavors (debug, release, static link, dynamic link) and all of these are mutually incompatible.\nIf you knew which one you were trying to use, the answer to your question would become obvious.\nIf you want the OS-provided libraries shared between all Windows applications, then kernel32.dll is the correct place to look, but the functions conform to the Win32 API specification, not the ANSI or ISO C standard.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9930730", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3"}}

{"text": "Q: How to search an encrypted attribute? I have a sensitive attribute that must be encrypted at all times except during display (not my rule and I think it's overkill, but I must follow this rule). Additionally, the secret used to encrypt/decrypt this data must not be on or accessible through the database. So currently I have a session for the user that stores their encrypted password and decrypts this data when needed. However, now I need to find records by the encrypted attribute. I currently utilize ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor for encryption/decryption of the attribute. Here's the direction I think I should go to accomplish this:\ndecryptor = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(encrypted_password)\nFamily.where(\"decryptor.decrypt_and_verify(name) == ?\", some_search_name)\n\nObviously the first side of that condition does not work as-is, but I need some way to do that. Any ideas?\n\nA: Quick Primer to Passwords in the DB\nThis goes to show that encryption in the database is hard, and that you shouldn't do it unless you have thought carefully through your threat model and understand what all the tradeoffs are.  To be honest, I have serious doubts that an ORM can ever give you the security you need where you need encryption (for important knowledge reasons), and on PostgreSQL, it is particularly hard because of the possibility of key disclosure in the log files.  In general you really need to properly protect both encrypted and plain text with regard to passwords, so you really don't want a relational interface here but a functional one, with a query running under a totally different set of permissions.\nNow, I can't tell in your example whether you are trying to protect passwords, but if you are, that's entirely the wrong way to go about it.  My example below is going to use MD5.  Now I am aware that MD5 is frowned upon by the crypto community because of the relatively short output, but it has the advantage in this case of not requiring pg_crypto to support and being likely stronger than attacking the password directly (in the context of short password strings, it is likely \"good enough\" particularly when combined with other measures).\nNow what you want to do is this:  you want to salt the password, then hash it, and then search the hashed value.  The most performant way to do this would be to have a users table which does not include the password, but does include the salt, and a shadow table which includes the hashed password but not the user-accessible data.  The shadow table would be restricted to its owner and that owner would have access to the user table too.\nThen you could write a function like this:\n CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_userid_by_password(in_username text, in_password text)\n RETURNS INT LANGUAGE SQL AS\n $$\n      SELECT user_id \n        FROM shadow\n        JOIN users ON users.id = shadow.user_id\n       WHERE users.username = $1 AND shadow.hashed_password = md5(users.salt || $2);\n $$ SECURITY DEFINER;\n ALTER FUNCTION get_userid_by_password(text, text) OWNER TO shadow_owner;\n\nYou would then have to drop to SQL to run this function (don't go through your ORM).  However you could index shadow.hashed_password and have it work with an index here (because the matching hash could be generated before scanning the table), and you are reasonably protected against SQL injections giving away the password hashes.  You still have to make sure that logging will not be generally enabled of these queries and there are a host of other things to  consider, but it gives you an idea of how best to manage passwords per se.  Alternatively in your ORM you could do something that would have a resulting SQL query like:\n  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = get_userid_by_password($username, $password)\n\n(The above is pseudocode and intended only for illustration purposes.  If you use a raw query like that assembled as a text string you are asking for SQL injection.)\nWhat if it isn't a password?\nIf you need reversible encryption, then you need to go further.  Note that in the example above, the index could be used because I was searching merely for an equality on the encrypted data.  Searching for an unencrypted data means that indexes are not usable.  If you index the unencrypted data then why are you encrypting it in the first place?  Also decryption does place burdens on the processor so it will be slow.\nIn all cases you need to carefully think through your threat model and ask how other vulnerabilities could make your passwords less secure.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18086060", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

You'll need to research your particular flight control software to see what it supports.  You'll also need to learn what each command does and how it is used, which isn't always obvious.\nThis page at the ArduPilot wiki is a good place to start, because it describes the commands implemented by a popular flight controller (ArduCopter), describes what the commands do, and exactly what the command parameters mean: http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/mission-planning-and-analysis/mission-command-list/\nYou will have to do a little translation because that page uses command names as they show up in a ground control station; For example Takeoff -> MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF, Condition-Delay -> MAV_CMD_CONDITION_DELAY.\nThere are a lot of commands, and some of them are esoteric, but to fly a basic mission where the vehicle takes off, flies through some waypoints, and then lands, you only need a few commands:\nMAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LAND\nMAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT\n\n\nA: The best list of mission commands for ArduPilot flight controller is MAVLink Mission Command Messages (MAV_CMD).

The DroneKit API documentation identifies the built in commands here:\nhttp://python.dronekit.io/automodule.html\nThat said, it looks like the DroneKit function send_mavlink() should allow you to send any mavlink message to your vehicle, in the event that there is a specific mavlink command not available in DroneKit.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: There are mainly 3 different types of executables:\n\n\n*\n\n*A console application is reading from stdin or a file and writing to stdout or a file and outputs error messages to stderr.\nThe processing of a batch file is halted on starting a console application until the console application terminated itself. The correct term is therefore: calling a console application.\nThe exit code of the console application is assigned to environment variable ERRORLEVEL and can be also directly evaluated for example with if errorlevel X rem do something\nMany *.exe in System32 directory of Windows are such console applications, like find.exe, findstr.exe, ping.exe, ...\n\n*A GUI (graphical user interface) application is started as new process which means the Windows command processor does not halt batch processing until the GUI application terminates itself.\nIt is not easily possible to get something from within a command process from such applications. GUI applications are designed for interacting via a graphical user interface with a user and not via standard streams or files with a command process.\nA typical example for such applications is Windows Explorer explorer.exe in Windows directory.\n\n*A hybrid application supports both interfaces and can be therefore used from within a command process as well as by a user via GUI.\nHybrid applications are rare because not easy to code. The behavior of hybrid applications on usage from within a batch file must be find out by testing.\nExample for such applications are Windows Registry Editor regedit.exe or shareware archiver tool WinRAR WinRAR.exe.\nIt is best to look on simple examples to see the differences regarding starting/calling all 3 types of applications from within a batch file.\nExample for console application:\n@echo off\ncls\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ping.exe 127.0.0.1 -n 5\necho.\necho Ping finished pinging the own computer (localhost).\necho.\npause\n\nThe command processing is halted until ping.exe terminated itself which takes 4 seconds. There is no need for start or call for such applications, except the console application should be intentionally executed in a separate process.\nExample for a GUI application:\n@echo off\ncls\n%WinDir%\\Explorer.exe\necho.\necho Windows Explorer opened and is still running!\necho.\npause\n\nThis batch file outputs the text and message prompt to press any key immediately after starting Windows Explorer indicating that Windows Explorer was started as separate process and Windows command processor immediately continued on the next lines of the batch file. So although Windows Explorer was started and is still running, the batch processing continued, too.\nExample for a hybrid application:\n@echo off\ncls\n\"%ProgramFiles%\\WinRAR\\WinRAR.exe\"\necho.\necho User exited WinRAR.\necho.\npause\n\nThis batch file starts WinRAR without any parameter (usually not useful from within a batch file) if being installed at all in default installation directory. But batch processing is halted until the user exited WinRAR for example by clicking on X symbol of the WinRAR\u00b4s application window.\nBut opening a command prompt window and executing from within the window\n\"%ProgramFiles%\\WinRAR\\WinRAR.exe\"\n\nresults in getting immediately the prompt back in command window to type and execute the next command. So WinRAR finds out what is the parent process and acts accordingly.\nWindows Registry Editor shows the same behavior. Executing from within a command prompt window\n%WinDir%\\regedit.exe\n\nresults in opening Windows Registry Editor, but next command can be immediately entered in command prompt window. But using this command in a batch file results in halting batch processing until GUI window of Windows Registry Editor is closed by the user.\nTherefore hybrid applications are used from within a batch file mainly with parameters to avoid the necessity of user interaction.\n\nOkay, back to the question after this brief lesson about various types of applications.\nFirst suggestion is using\nResult\\TextFileName.txt\n\ninstead of\nResult/TextFileName.txt\n\nas the directory separator on Windows is the backslash character, except the executables require forward slashes as directory separator because of being badly ported from Unix/Linux to Windows.\nSecond suggestion is finding out type of application. Is command start really necessary because the applications don't start itself in a separate process and need user interaction to terminate itself?\nNote: Command start interprets first double quoted string as title string. Therefore it is always good to specify as first parameter \"\" (empty title string) on starting a GUI or hybrid application as a separate process. On starting a console application as a separate process it is in general a good idea to give the console window a meaningful title.\nAnd last if the started applications really would need user interaction to terminate, it would be definitely better to either start and kill them after waiting 1 or more seconds between start and kill or start them all, wait a few seconds and finally kill them all at once.\nExample for first solution with starting and killing each application separately:\n@echo off\nsetlocal\nset TimeoutInSeconds=3\ncall :RunApp IEPassView\ncall :RunApp MailPassView\ncall :RunApp MessenPass\ncall :RunApp RouterPassView\ncall :RunApp ProtectedStoragePassView\ncall :RunApp DialUpPassView\nendlocal\ngoto :EOF\n\n:RunApp\nstart \"\" \"%~1.exe\" /stext \"Results\\%~1.txt\"\nset /A RetryNumber=TimeoutInSeconds + 1\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ping.exe 127.0.0.1 -n %RetryNumber% >nul\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"%~1.exe\"\ngoto :EOF\n\nIt is also possible to use timeout instead of ping for the delay if the batch file is only for Windows Vista and later Windows versions.\nExample for second solution with starting all applications, wait some seconds and kill them finally all:\n@echo off\ncall :StartApp IEPassView\ncall :StartApp MailPassView\ncall :StartApp MessenPass\ncall :StartApp RouterPassView\ncall :StartApp ProtectedStoragePassView\ncall :StartApp DialUpPassView\n\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ping.exe 127.0.0.1 -n 6 >nul\n\ncall :KillApp IEPassView\ncall :KillApp MailPassView\ncall :KillApp MessenPass\ncall :KillApp RouterPassView\ncall :KillApp ProtectedStoragePassView\ncall :KillApp DialUpPassView\n\ngoto :EOF\n\n:StartApp\nstart \"\" \"%~1.exe\" /stext \"Results\\%~1.txt\"\ngoto :EOF\n\n:KillApp\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"%~1.exe\"\ngoto :EOF\n\nFor understanding the used commands and how they work, open a command prompt window, execute there the following commands, and read entirely all help pages displayed for each command very carefully.\n\n\n*\n\n*call /?\n\n*echo /?\n\n*endlocal /?\n\n*goto /?\n\n*ping /?\n\n*set /?\n\n*setlocal /?\n\n*start /?\n\n*taskkill /?\nSee also the Microsoft article about Using command redirection operators.\nPS: The last two batch code blocks were not tested by me because of not having available the applications.\n\nA: I suggest killing all tasks at once, at the end of the very end, possibly after a timeout command with a amount of time appropriate to your system's speed. That may help the issue.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36995755", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}

{"text": "Q: How to split a sequence in k homogeneous parts? I'd like to split a sequence into k parts, and optimize the homogeneity of these sub-parts.\nExample : 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 1 0 0 0\nResult  : 0 0 0 0 0 | 1 1 2 | 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 | 1 0 0 0 when you ask for 4 parts (k = 4)\n\nHere, the algorithm did not try to split in fixed-length parts, but instead tried to make sure elements in the same parts are as homogeneous as possible.\nWhat algorithm should I use ? Is there an implementation of it in R ?\n\nA: Maybe you can use Expectation-maximization algorithm. Your points would be (value, position). In your example, this would be something like:\n\nWith the E-M algorithm, the result would be something like (by hand):\n\nThis is the desired output, so you can consider using this, and if it really works in all your scenarios. An annotation, you must assign previously the number of clusters you want, but I think it's not a problem for you, as you have set out your question.\nLet me know if this worked ;)\nEdit:\nSee this picture, is what you talked about. With k-means you should control the delta value, this is, how the position increment, to have its value to the same scale that value. But with E-M this doesn't matter.\n\nEdit 2:\nOk I was not correct, you need to control the delta value. It is not the same if you increment position by 1 or by 3: (two clusters)\n\nThus, as you said, this algorithm could decide to cluster points that are not neighbours if their position is far but their value is close. You need to guarantee this not to happen, with a high increment of delta. I think that with a increment of 2 * (max - min) values of your sequence this wouldn't happen.\nNow, your points would have the form (value, delta * position).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39224665", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Calculate posterior distribution of unknown mis-classification with PRTools in MATLAB I'm using the PRTools MATLAB library to train some classifiers, generating test data and testing the classifiers. \nI have the following details:\n\n\n*\n\n*N: Total # of test examples \n\n*k: # of\nmis-classification for each\nclassifier and class\n\n\nI want to  do:\nCalculate and plot Bayesian posterior distributions of the unknown probabilities of mis-classification (denoted q), that is, as probability density functions over q itself (so, P(q) will be plotted over q, from 0 to 1).\nI have that (math formulae, not matlab code!):\nPosterior = Likelihood * Prior  / Normalization constant = \nP(q|k,N)  = P(k|q,N)   * P(q|N) / P(k|N)\n\nThe prior is set to 1, so I only need to calculate the likelihood and normalization constant. \nI know that the likelihood can be expressed as (where B(N,k) is the binomial coefficient):\nP(k|q,N) = B(N,k) * q^k * (1-q)^(N-k)\n\n... so the Normalization constant is simply an integral of the posterior above, from 0 to 1:\nP(k|N) = B(N,k) * integralFromZeroToOne( q^k * (1-q)^(N-k) )\n\n(The Binomial coefficient ( B(N,k) ) can be omitted though as it appears in both the likelihood and normalization constant)\nNow, I've heard that the integral for the normalization constant should be able to be calculated as a series ... something like:\nk!(N-k)! / (N+1)!\n\nIs that correct? (I have some lecture notes with this series, but can't figure out if it is for the normalization constant integral, or for the overall distribution of mis-classification (q))\nAlso, hints are welcome as how to practically calculate this? (factorials are easily creating truncation errors right?) ... AND, how to practically calculate the final plot (the posterior distribution over q, from 0 to 1).\n\nA: I really haven't done much with Bayesian posterior distributions ( and not for a while), but I'll try to help with what you've given. First,\nk!(N-k)! / (N+1)! = 1 / (B(N,k) * (N + 1))\n\nand you can calculate the binomial coefficients in Matlab with nchoosek() though it does say in the docs that there can be accuracy problems for large coefficients. How big are N and k?\nSecond, according to Mathematica,\nintegralFromZeroToOne( q^k * (1-q)^(N-k) ) = pi * csc((k-N)*pi) * Gamma(1+k)/(Gamma(k-N) * Gamma(2+N))\n\nwhere csc() is the cosecant function and Gamma() is the gamma function. However, Gamma(x) = (x-1)! which we'll use in a moment. The problem is that we have a function Gamma(k-N) on the bottom and k-N will be negative. However, the reflection formula will help us with that so that we end up with:\n= (N-k)! * k! / (N+1)!\n\nApparently, your notes were correct.\n\nA: Let q be the probability of mis-classification. Then the probability that you would observe k mis-classifications in N runs is given by:\n\nP(k|N,q) = B(N,k) q^k (1-q)^(N-k)\n\nYou need to then assume a suitable prior for q which is bounded between 0 and 1. A conjugate prior for the above is the beta distribution. If q ~ Beta(a,b) then the posterior is also a Beta distribution. For your info the posterior is: \n\nf(q|-) ~ Beta(a+k,b+N-k)\n\nHope that helps.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2908923", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

When I do gradle test, however, I get the following error:\n$ gradle test --info\n<skipping some output here...>\n\nSuccessfully started process 'Gradle Test Executor 1'\nGradle Test Executor 1 started executing tests.\nWCCTest > testToyData FAILED\n    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory\n        at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.<clinit>(Configuration.java:142)\n        at WCCTest.testToyData(WCCTest.java:180)\n\n    Caused by:\n    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:366)\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:355)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:354)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:423)\n        at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:308)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:356)\n        ... 2 more\n\nGradle Test Executor 1 finished executing tests.\nWCCTest > testOnShorterPathFound FAILED\n    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration\n        at sun.reflect.GeneratedSerializationConstructorAccessor33.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:525)\n        at     org.objenesis.instantiator.sun.SunReflectionFactoryInstantiator.newInstance(SunReflectionFactoryInstantiator.java:40)\n        at org.objenesis.ObjenesisBase.newInstance(ObjenesisBase.java:59)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.createProxy(ClassImposterizer.java:128)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.imposterise(ClassImposterizer.java:63)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.imposterise(ClassImposterizer.java:56)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.CglibMockMaker.createMock(CglibMockMaker.java:23)\n        at org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil.createMock(MockUtil.java:26)\n        at org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore.mock(MockitoCore.java:51)\n        at org.mockito.Mockito.mock(Mockito.java:1243)\n        at org.mockito.Mockito.mock(Mockito.java:1120)\n        at org.apache.giraph.utils.MockUtils$MockedEnvironment.<init>(MockUtils.java:68)\n        at org.apache.giraph.utils.MockUtils.prepareVertexAndComputation(MockUtils.java:132)\n        at WCCTest.testOnShorterPathFound(WCCTest.java:64)\n\nWCCTest > testToyDataJson FAILED\n    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.giraph.conf.GiraphConfiguration\n        at WCCTest.testToyDataJson(WCCTest.java:127)\n\nWCCTest > testOnNoShorterPathFound FAILED\n    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration\n        at sun.reflect.GeneratedSerializationConstructorAccessor33.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:525)\n        at org.objenesis.instantiator.sun.SunReflectionFactoryInstantiator.newInstance(SunReflectionFactoryInstantiator.java:40)\n        at org.objenesis.ObjenesisBase.newInstance(ObjenesisBase.java:59)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.createProxy(ClassImposterizer.java:128)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.imposterise(ClassImposterizer.java:63)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.jmock.ClassImposterizer.imposterise(ClassImposterizer.java:56)\n        at org.mockito.internal.creation.CglibMockMaker.createMock(CglibMockMaker.java:23)\n        at org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil.createMock(MockUtil.java:26)\n        at org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore.mock(MockitoCore.java:51)\n        at org.mockito.Mockito.mock(Mockito.java:1243)\n        at org.mockito.Mockito.mock(Mockito.java:1120)\n        at org.apache.giraph.utils.MockUtils$MockedEnvironment.<init>(MockUtils.java:68)\n        at org.apache.giraph.utils.MockUtils.prepareVertexAndComputation(MockUtils.java:132)\n        at WCCTest.testOnNoShorterPathFound(WCCTest.java:95)\n\n4 tests completed, 4 failed\n<more output...>\n:test FAILED\n:test (Thread[main,5,main]) completed.

{"text": "Q: Entity Framework n to n relationship add object to another object I have a Model with Clients:\npublic class Client\n\n{\n    [Key]\n    public int id { get; set; }\n    [Required]\n    public string?

Clients { get; set; }\n    }\n\nThis is supposed to be an n to n connection. How can I add software to my clients?\nWhat I've tried:\npublic async void add(Software software)\n        {\n            using (var repo = new ClientRepository(contextFactory.CreateDbContext()))\n            {\n                client.Softwares.Add(software);\n                await repo.Save(client);\n            }\n\nRepository:\npublic async Task Save(Client client)\n        {\n            _context.Clients.Update(client);\n            _context.SaveChanges();\n        }\n        }\n\nThis works for the first software I add, but gives me the following error if I try to add a second one:\n\nSqlException: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_ClientSoftware'.\nCannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.ClientSoftware'. The\nduplicate key value is (7003, 5002).\n\n\nA: It seems you are adding more than one relation of the same. Before adding software to a client, make sure a relation does not exist yet, then you can go ahead and add software to client.\nAlso, you can improve your entities. Use better naming for the primary keys and add [Key] attribute to Software class as well.\nClient:\npublic class Client\n{\n    public Client()\n    {\n        Softwares = new HashSet<Software>();\n    }\n\n    [Key]\n    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]\n    public int ClientId { get; set; }\n    [Required]\n    public string Hostname { get; set; }\n    public ICollection<Software> Softwares { get; set; }\n}\n\nSoftware:\npublic class Software\n{\n    public Software()\n    {\n        Clients = new HashSet<Client>();\n    }\n    \n    [Key]\n    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]\n    public int SoftwareId { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public ICollection<Client> Clients { get; set; }\n}\n\nCheck if relation already exists:\n// Get the client including its related softwares\nvar client = dbContext.Clients.Include(x => x.Softwares)\n    .FirstOrDefault(x => x.Hostname == \"Ibrahim\");\n\n\nif (client != null)\n{\n    // Check with unique property such as name of software\n    // If it does not exist in this current client, then add software\n    if (!client.Softwares.Any(x => x.Name == software.Name))\n        client.Softwares.Add(software);\n\n    dbContext.SaveChanges();\n}\n\nNote: If you update your entities, remember to create new migration and database.\n\nA: \nQ: Do you make a new one with new() every time?\n\n\nA: no, its a software that already exists\n\nThen that is the error.\nThe first SaveChanges() will start tracking it as Existing. You can check: The Id will be != 0.\nWhen you then later add it to the same Client you'll get the duplicate error.\nSo somewher in your code:\n  await add(software);       // existing\n  software = new Software(); // add this \n\nRelated, change:\npublic async void add(Software software)\n\nto\npublic async Task Add(Software software)\n\nAlways avoid async void.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74361667", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
{"text": "Q: List private property names of the class I need to use some subset of class properties names as values in a map to use inside of the class. In following example I've replaced map by array. The problem is that if property is marked private it's not listed in keyof list. How can I specify type of keys if I need to include private names?\nvar keys: Array<keyof A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // Error\n\nclass A {\n  private x = 7;\n  public y = 8;\n\n  private keys: Array<keyof A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // Error\n}\n\nThere is the same error both for variable outside of the class and for private property inside of it:\n\nType '\"x\"' is not assignable to type '\"y\"'.\n\n\nA: As you noticed, private and protected properties of a class C do not appear as part of keyof C.  This is usually desirable behavior, since most attempts to index into a class with a private/protected property will cause a compile error.  There is a suggestion at microsoft/TypeScript#22677 to allow mapping a type to a version where the private/protected properties are public, which would give you a way to do this... but this feature has not been implemented as of TypeScript 4.9.\nSo this doesn't work:\nnamespace Privates {\n  export class A {\n    private x: string = \"a\";\n    public y: number = 1;\n    private keys: Array<keyof A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // Error\n  }\n  var keys: Array<keyof A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // Error\n}\nconst privateA = new Privates.A();\nprivateA.y; // number\nprivateA.x; // error: it's private\nprivateA.keys; // error: it's private\n\nBut maybe you don't actually need the properties to be private, so much as not visible to outside users of the class.  You can use a module/namespace to export only the facets of your class that you want, like this:\nnamespace NotExported {\n  class _A {\n    x: string = \"a\";\n    y: number = 1;\n    keys: Array<keyof _A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // okay\n  }\n  export interface A extends Omit<_A, \"x\" | \"keys\"> {}\n  export const A: new () => A = _A;\n  var keys: Array<keyof _A> = [\"x\", \"y\"]; // okay\n}\n\nconst notExportedA = new NotExported.A();\nnotExportedA.y; // number\nnotExportedA.x; // error: property does not exist\nnotExportedA.keys; // error: property does not exist\n\nIn NotExported, the class constructor _A and the corresponding type _A are not directly exported.  Internally, keyof _A contains both the \"x\" and \"y\" keys.  What we do export is a constructor A and a corresponding type A that omits the x property (and keys property) from _A.  So you get the internal behavior you desire, while the external behavior of NotExported.A is similar to that of Privates.A.  Instead of x and keys being inaccessible due to private violation, they are inaccessible because they are not part of the exported A type.\nI actually prefer the latter method of not exporting implementation details rather than exposing the existence of private properties, since private properties actually have a lot of impact on how the corresponding classes can be used.  That is, private is about access control, not about encapsulation.\nLink to code\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57066049", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6"}}

What I do is create a dictionary, using the first number as the index, and stuffing the other two fields into a System.ValueTuple (you need to include the ValueTyple Nuget package to get this to work).\nFirst I set some stuff up:\n const int column1Start = 0;\n const int column1Length = 3;\n const int column2Start = 8;\n const int column2Length = 15;\n const int column3Start = 24;\n\n int indexMin = int.MaxValue;     //calculated during the first\n int indexMax = int.MinValue;     //pass through the file\n\nThen I create my dictionary.  That (string, decimal) syntax describes a 2-tuple that contains a string and a decimal number (kind of like the ordered-pairs you were taught about in high school).\n Dictionary<int, (string, decimal)> data = new Dictionary<int, (string, decimal)>();\n\nThen I make a pass through the file's lines, reading through the data, and stuffing the results in my dictionary (and calculating the max and min values for that first column):\n var lines = File.ReadAllLines(fileName);\n foreach (var line in lines) {\n     //no error checking\n     var indexString = line.Substring(column1Start, column1Length);\n     var cartoon = line.Substring(column2Start, column2Length).TrimEnd();\n     var numberString = line.Substring(column3Start);\n\n     if (int.TryParse(indexString, out var index)) {\n         //I have to parse the first number - otherwise there's nothing to index on\n         if (!decimal.TryParse(numberString, out var number)){\n             number = 0.0M;\n         }\n         data.Add(index, (cartoon, number));\n\n         if (index < indexMin) {\n             indexMin = index;\n         }\n         if (index > indexMax) {\n             indexMax = index;\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nFinally, with all my data in hand, I iterate from the min value to the max value, fetching the other two columns out of my dictionary:\n for (int i = indexMin; i <= indexMax; ++i) {\n     if (!data.TryGetValue(i, out var val)){\n         val = (\"0\", 0.0M);\n     }\n     Console.WriteLine($\"{i,5}  {val.Item1,-column2Length - 2}  {val.Item2, 10:N}\");\n }\n\nMy formatting isn't quite the same as yours (I cleaned it up a bit).

Since you're flagging objects being transferred to or from clients I would go with the PublicAPIAttribute first.\n\nSince you say in a comment that the PublicAPIAttribute didn't work but UsedImplicitlyAttribute did then I guess they do have different meanings.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39506938", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

It was a 2D array of doubles like:\n/**\n * This is the probability-matrix for reaching from any profile\n * to another by randomly selecting a friend from the friendlist.\n */\nstatic const double F[5][5] = {\n  /*           P    , F    , L    , A    , S    */\n  /* Peter */ {0    , 0.5  , 0.5  , 0    , 0    },\n  /* Franz */ {1.0  , 0    , 0    , 0    , 0    },\n  /* Lisa  */ {0    , 1/3.0, 0    , 1/3.0, 1/3.0},\n  /* Anna  */ {0    , 0    , 0    , 0    , 1    },\n  /* Sepp  */ {0    , 0.5  , 0.5  , 0    , 0    }\n};\n\nI wanted my functions to not be fixed to operate on 5-by-5 matrices so I always pass the number of rows and/or cols to the function. This forces me not to use the double [][X] syntax because it can not be completely \"variable\" and instead use a double* as function parameter.\ninline size_t matrix_get(int rows, int i, int j);\n\ninline void matrix_print(double* m, int rows, int cols);\n\ninline void matrix_copy(double* d, const double* s, int rows, int cols);\n\nvoid matrix_multiply(\n  int m, int n, int l,\n  const double* a, const double* b, double* d);\n\nBut I always get this warning when calling a function that accepts double* when I passed double [5][5] instead.\nfuenf_freunde.c:138:17: warning: incompatible pointer types passing 'double [5][5]' to parameter of\n      type 'double *' [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]\n  matrix_print( R, 5, 5);\n                ^\nfuenf_freunde.c:54:27: note: passing argument to parameter 'm' here\nvoid matrix_print(double* m, int rows, int cols)\n                          ^\n\nCasting using (double*) F resolves the warning. \nNow my questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*am I wrong casting a 2D double array to a double pointer?\n\n*why is it working if its illegal?\n\n*what is the right way to pass an n-dimensional arbitrary size array to a function?\n\n\nEDIT: This cleared a lot up for me: Accesing a 2D array using a single pointer\nSo I should just use double[x*y] instead of double[x][y] I think. But is it legal to cast double[] to double*?\n\nA: I contend that there is nothing wrong with what you do. Your code just lacks an explicit cast which would get rid of the warning, indicating that your assignment is intentional. \nYou can access a one dimensional array through a pointer to its elements, and recursively applied, it follows that n-dimensional matrices can be accessed through pointers to the atomic elements. \nC guarantees a contiguous memory layout for them. This pattern is common. In  fact passing arrays is hard or impossible to do differently, given the little information C stores with types (as opposed to, say, C#). So the matrix decays to a pointer to its first element (in your case to the first one dimensional array), which can safely be cast to an address of its first element, a double. They all share the same numerical address.\nTypical concerns with pointer type casting are aliasing issues with modern optimizing compilers (a compiler can assume that you don't access memory through pointers of unrelated types except char*), but there is an explicit exemption in the standard draft 1570 which I have, par. 6.5.7, which I think is applicable here:\n\nAn object [that would be a double in your matrix, -ps] shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue\n  expression that has one of the following types: \n\u2014 a type compatible with the effective type of the object [that would be a dereferenced double pointer, -ps]\n  [...] \n\u2014 an aggregate [e.g. array, -ps]\n  [...] type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its\n  members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or\n  contained union) [that would be your matrix variable, containing, eventually, doubles, -ps]\n[...]\n\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29666141", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: Need help setup windows server 2008 SMTP server I am trying to setup windows server 2008 smtp server to relay emails to gmail smtp. Everything appears to be setup but it is not sending emails. Could you please help me figure out whats wrong.\nBelow is the setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows server 2008 with SMTP server\nfeature installed. Need SMTP server\nto forward all messages to gmail smtp\nserver to send. \n\n*I have google apps    setup for my\ndomain, also I can send    emails\nthrought my test app using\ngmail smtp.\n\n*SMTP Server Configuration: By default has default smtp server virtual directory.\n\n*In Properties of that virtual smtp server changed following.\n\n*Fully qualified domain name = mydomain.com\n\n*smart host = smtp.gmail.com\n\n*TCP Port = 587\n\n*Out Bound Security = Basic Authentication(my username password for google apps email account)\n\n*In domains list under virtual smtp server. I have one default domain that's server dns. I added another one for my domain name.\n\n\nWith above setup i am trying to redirect all email to gmail smtp. \nI tested connection to smtp.gmail.com from server on port 587 through telnet and it works.\nI am trying to use above server from my web application also by just dropping emails in pickup directory. It get's picked up and also accepts request form web application but never sends an email.\nI can see that it adds those emails in queue folder but it stays there forever.\nWhen i try to send emails from web app to above server it rejects if To address is other than my domain.(Am i missing something in list of domains)\n\nA: Thanks for all answers, finally found solution there is a property for maximum sessions which value was 0 by default. Changed it to 100 and it send all pending emails immediately.\n\nA: This souds like a DNS issue. Check your /badmail directory. It will have .bad and .bdp files in there. You can open these in notepad (there will be some binary in there).\nHowever, it may point to the possible problem.\nYou may also want to try and enable logging on the SMTP service. There may be something in there.\n\nA: Possible reasons are that some SMTP servers block the outgoing messages if there domain name mismatch, possible to prevent spam mails from being sent. So for example, I will not be able to send my email with an address abc@mydomain.com from my domain yourdomain.com.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Ensure your sending domain is the same as the google apps domain\nEnsure your sending address is a real address and not just an alias\nIIRC you need to use STARTTLS (SSL) not basic authentication\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/669754", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

{"text": "Q: cudaMemcpy returns cudaErrorInvalidArgument when reading from Device to Host, unclear why first post here. I'm currently working on a project that requires writing a large 2d array (on the order of 1,000,000x7) into my GPU, doing some computation, and returning it to the Host. Since I want to do so quickly and with such a large array, I attempted to flatten the array to help pass it into the GPU fairly straightforwardly. The array successfully writes (or at least cudaMalloc and cudaMemcpy both return cudaSuccess when I write to the device), but when I try to read it out cudaMemcpy returns an invalid argument error.\nI've not been able to figure out why this is, since I think I should be writing a valid 1d array (flattened) onto the device and reading it back out, and I thought I was feeding the right arguments to do this. The only results for this error I've found online involve swapping the dst and src arguments for cudaMemcpy, but I think I've got those right here.\nThis is a simplified version of my code that reproduces the problem:\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid alloc2dArray(float ** &arr, unsigned long int rows, unsigned long int cols){ \n\n    arr = new float*[rows];\n\n    arr[0] = new float[rows * cols];\n\n    for(unsigned long int i = 1; i < rows; i++) arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + cols;\n}\n\nvoid write2dArrayToGPU(float ** arr, float * devPtr, unsigned long int rows, unsigned long int cols){\n\n    if(cudaSuccess != cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, sizeof(float) * rows * cols)) cerr << \"cudaMalloc Failed\";\n\n    if(cudaSuccess != cudaMemcpy(devPtr, arr[0], sizeof(float) * rows * cols, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)) cerr << \"cudaMemcpy Write Failed\";\n}\n\nvoid read2dArrayFromGPU(float ** arr, float * devPtr, unsigned long int rows, unsigned long int cols){\n\n    if(cudaSuccess != cudaMemcpy(arr[0], devPtr, sizeof(float) * rows * cols, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost)) cerr << \"cudaMemcpy Read Failed\" << endl;\n}\n\nint main(){\n\nint R = 100;\nint C = 7;\n\ncout << \"Allocating an \" << R << \"x\" << C << \" array ...\";\nfloat ** arrA;\nalloc2dArray(arrA, R, C);\n\n\ncout << \"Assigning some values ...\";\nfor(int i = 0; i < R; i++){\n    for(int j = 0; j < C; j++){\n        arrA[i][j] = i*C + j;\n    }\n}\ncout << \"Done!\" << endl;\n\n\ncout << \"Writing to the GPU ...\";\nfloat * Darr = 0;\nwrite2dArrayToGPU(arrA, Darr, R, C);\ncout << \" Done!\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"Allocating second \" << R << \"x\" << C << \" array ...\";\nfloat ** arrB;\nalloc2dArray(arrB, R, C);\ncout << \"Done!\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"Reading from the GPU into the new array ...\";\nread2dArrayFromGPU(arrB, Darr, R, C);\n\n\n}\n\nI compile and run this on my laptop with \n $nvcc -arch=sm_30 test.cu -o test\n $optirun cuda-memcheck ./test\n\nand get the result:\n========= CUDA-MEMCHECK\nAllocating an 100x7 array ...Assigning some values ...Done!\nWriting to the GPU ...

The text prop specifically expects a string. The content prop will accept anything, including other React components or nodes. So instead of returning text as a string, you could do something like this for content, maybe as a separate class method on your component:\nconst renderItemContent = (member) => {\n  const {\n    email,\n    name,\n  } = member.user;\n\n  const emailStyle = {\n    color    : '#333',\n    fontSize : '.875em',\n  }\n\n  return(\n    <React.Fragment>\n      {name}\n      {email &&\n        <div style={emailStyle}>{email}</div>\n      }\n    </React.Fragment>\n  )\n}\n\nThen set content: this.renderItemContent(member) on your memberOptionsArray.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50129466", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Communicating between Kernel Threads in Linux I am porting a app/PCI driver from vxWorks to Linux and I would like to keep the same architecture if possible.  The current driver has 2 tasks(threads) that communicate with each other using message queues.  Is there a mechanism to communicate between kernel threads?  The message queues are being used to pass buffer addresses and size info so the tasks can use DMA to move large amounts of data.\n\nA: It sounds like the workqueue interface might be what you're after - or for something lighter-weight, a kfifo combined with a rwsem semaphore.\n\nA: I would strongly advise against keeping the VxWorks architecture on Linux. Kernel thread proliferation is frowned upon, your code will never make it into official kernel tree. Even if you don't care about that, are you 100% sure that you want to develop a driver in a non-standard way ? Things would be much simpler if you would just get rid of these two tasks. BTW, why on earth you need tasks for PCI driver to begin with ? \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1442270", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: Django Attribute Error - Form object has no attribute 'is_valid' I am receiving an error, object has no attribute 'is_valid', when trying to insert form data into a form. Below is the structure of my code:\nViews.py:\ndef add_user(request):\n    form = Car(request.POST)\n    if request.method == 'POST' and form.is_valid():\n        last_store = form.cleaned_data.get['value']\n        make = request.POST.get('make', '')\n        model = request.POST.get('model', '')\n        ..\n\n        car_obj = Car(last_store = last_store, make = make, model = model, series = series, series_year = series_year, price_new = price_new, engine_size = engine_size, fuel_system = fuel_system, tank_capacity = tank_capacity, power = power, seating_capacity = seating_capacity, standard_transmission = standard_transmission,  body_type = body_type, drive = drive, wheelbase = wheelbase, available = available)\n        car_obj.save()\n        return HttpResponseRedirect('/inventory/add/')\n    else:\n        form = Car()\n\n    return render(request, 'cars/inventory-add.html', {})\n\nClass:\nclass Car(models.Model):\n    make = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=False)\n    model = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=False)\n    series = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=False)\n    series_year = models.IntegerField(null=False)\n    price_new = models.IntegerField(null=False)\n    ..\n    last_store = models.ForeignKey(Store, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, related_name=\"last_store\")\n    available = models.BooleanField(null=False, default=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return(self.make + \" \" + self.model)\n\nCarForm (forms.py)\nclass CarForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Car\n        fields = ['last_store', 'make', 'model', 'series', 'series_year', 'price_new', 'engine_size', 'fuel_system', 'tank_capacity', 'power', 'seating_capacity', 'standard_transmission', 'body_type', 'drive', 'wheelbase', 'available']\n\nThe error lies within the last_store as without form.is_valid(), apparently I cannot use form.cleaned_data, but form.is_valid() seems to not even exist? As seen in the class, last_store is of type a foreign key, therefore I am struggling to set the default value for it when the user enters input into the form. The last_store variable is attempting to fetch the value from the inputted form data which consists of a SELECT option..\n\nA: You have a clash between your model and form, which are both named Car. Typically you would fix this by renaming the form CarForm.\nNote that you shouldn't normally need to create the object with car_obj = Car(...). If you use a model form, you can simplify your code to car_obj = form.save(). You should also move CarForm(request.POST) inside the if request.method == 'POST' check, and include form in the template context. Putting that together, you get something like:\ndef add_user(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        form = CarForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            car_obj = form.save()\n            return HttpResponseRedirect('/inventory/add/')\n    else:\n        form = CarForm()\n    return render(request, 'cars/inventory-add.html', {'form': form})\n\n\nA: In your views.py file line 2\nform = Car(request.POST):\n\nchange it to\nform = CarForm(request.POST):\n\nHope it works!\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52952348", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

{"text": "Q: Keep icon bar floated right and wrap text around I have a little header bar in html/css where there are a couple icons floated to the right side. I want them to remain in position and have the title (on the left) just wrap below if the area gets too small on the right side. Right now, my html looks like so (using bootstrap) :\n <div class=\"activity-panel-item--header\">\n     <div class=\"col-sm-8\"><p>02 Development, LLC v. 607 South Park, LLC </p></div>\n     <div class=\"col-sm-4\"><span class=\"icon icon-trash-o pull-right\"></span><span class=\"icon icon-cog2 pull-right\"></span><span class=\"icon icon-pencil3 pull-right\"></span></div>\n</div>\n\nSo I have a col-sm-8 and col-sm-4. This will not work in the long run because col-sm-4 is too small in certain sizes, so I need to make the right column with the icon have a set width (140px lets say). So if a set a min-width on the right side it's going break on smaller sizes.\nWhat I am wondering if, is there a way to let that title on the left side in the col-sm-8 move around the set width buttons on the right side when responsive (i basically want the buttons to stay in the same place the whole time). Something like if the buttons on the right were absolutely position but not out of the flow so the text reacts to it.\nHere is a fiddle I was fooling with https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/24085/\nEDIT \nSo I improvised a solution by doing the following :\n- taking the right icon-bar element out of the dom flow by absolutely positioning it and giving it a set with\n- adding the same width as padding to the element wrapping both the left and the right items\nI could then just do away with the col's all together. The code looks like so :\nHTML:\n  <div class=\"activity-panel-item col-md-12\">\n    <div class=\"activity-panel-item--header\">\n\n      <p>02 Development, LLC v. 607 South Park, LLC </p>\n      <div class=\"activity-panel-item--header--iconbar\">\n        <span class=\"icon icon-trash-o pull-right\">1</span><span class=\"icon icon-cog2 pull-right\">2</span><span class=\"icon icon-pencil3 pull-right\">3</span>\n  </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"activity-panel-item--body\">\n      <p>test 123345.</p>\n      <h3></h3>\n      <p>cases</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\nCSS: \n.activity-panel-item {\n  height: 100%;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n.activity-panel-item--header {\n  position: fixed;\n  width: 100%;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  padding: 12px 125px 12px 12px;\n  min-height: 50px;\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\n}\n\n.activity-panel-item--header p {\n  color: #fff;\n}\n\n.activity-panel-item--header .icon {\n  cursor: pointer;\n  color: #fff;\n  margin: 0px 12px;\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.activity-panel-item--body {\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  display: block;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%\n}\n\n.activity-title-input {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n.activity-panel-item--header--iconbar {\n  display: block;\n  float: right;\n  top: 10px;\n  right: 10px;\n  width: 125px;\n  min-height: 50px;\n  height: auto;\n  position: absolute;\n}\n\nSee working fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/24114/ \nAny and all input would be helpful, or if anyone has a different working approach that would be great also. Thanks!\n\nA: You can do it without bootstrap col-*-* and by giving the explicit width to both divs, plus little extra style to your icon bar.\nUpdated Code\n<div class=\"activity-panel-item--header\">\n  <div class=\"pull-left\" style=\"width: 75%;\">\n    <p>02 Development, LLC v. 607 South Park, LLC </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"pull-right\" style=\"position: absolute; right: 0px; min-width: 25%;\"><span class=\"icon icon-trash-o pull-right\">1</span><span class=\"icon icon-cog2 pull-right\">2</span><span class=\"icon icon-pencil3 pull-right\">3</span></div>\n</div>\n\njsFiddle\nEDIT 1\nIf you think deeply according to this solution we both are at same point. Let me explain, I am giving minimum width 25% to icon bar and 75% width to left element. That mean depending on situation width of icon bar can be increase but it must be at least 25% of total screen or container and width of left element is 75% that can be decrease depending on situation. \nAnd you are giving width 125px or any to icon bar that means it can be increase or decrease depending on situation but the original is 125px\nHere the situation I mean area and screen resolution. If icon are larger and not fit in 25% then this width can be increase and left element can be decrease same is your edited case if icon bar not fit in 125px then this width can be increase because we are not mentioning the maximum width to icon bar or minimum width to left element.\n.\nEDIT 2\nI hope this is not illegal on stackoverflow to edit answer as many time as I need.\nApart from coding let\u2019s do some math. Suppose we have 3 icon of (32x32) each. So the total width of icon wrapper will (32+32+32) 96px add little margin of 12px to each icon (12x3=36) on right side for beauty. Now the wrapper width is 96+36 = 132px. And we are on device that has width of 400px. My icon wrapper is (25%) 100px of 400px (device width) and your wrapper is 125px. I am saying OK browser minimum width of icon wrapper is 100px but if icons are larger and not fit in 100px you can increase this width according to you need, In this case it will increase 100px to 132px or any. But I don't want to break these icons to next line. They should be display in their original size and style (32x32) plus margin. You can break left content (text) to wrap around these icons but don't break the icons itself. They should retain their original size. No matter what ever device width is. Browser, Please don't decrease the icon size just increase wrapper width.\nAnd your 125px is less than 132px. So your wrapper will break and one of its icon will move to next line. Until you have to go to you CSS and explicitly wrote 132px or any in width. And what if after one month your boss said please place icon of 40x40 and after 3 month and so on...?\nTry it, place larger icons and see what happens to your width: 125px.\n\nA: Unless I am totally misunderstanding you.. here is a easy method. Too much CSS \nclasses so I used my own but you get the concept. \n<div class=\"top\">\n<div class=\"content1\">\n    <p>02 Development, LLC v. 607 South Park, LLC </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content2\">\n    <span>1</span>\n    <span>2</span>\n    <span>3</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"content3\">\n    <p>test 123345.</p>\n    <h3>Nothing Here</h3>\n    <p>cases</p>\n</div>\n\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/norcaljohnny/ovo83p5k/\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39153253", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "5"}}

{"text": "Q: How can I create views with dynamic content in iOS? I' m encountered with a problem because of my lack of knowledge of iOS platform I think.I have a view controller User Profile. The main view has next structure: ScrollView which contains one subview and this UIView has 7 UIViews with UILabels, UItextViews, UIImageViews, etc. each of them displays specific info about user. The problem - data for this views is fetched from the server and it can be different. E.g I have a subview Education, it contains next info: name of the institute, degree, years of learning, etc. But one user can have several educations. So the size of this view can be dynamic. But i can't simply change the view size with view.frame = CGRectMake because under it I have a view job experience and etc. Or for example professional skills view: it can be one skill and it can be one hundred skills for one user -so I need to change the size of this view but under it I have another view so i need to move it and so on and so forth. So the question what is the correct way of dealing with this situation? I understood that I can't just change view frames with view.frame= CGRectMake() - because it is too much work and it is a stupid approach I think. I know there must be some more straightforward way for this very common problem, may be autolayout or something else? Anyway I hope for some help and advice of how can I make views with dynamic content. \n\nA: I really don't know why you said \"I can't just change view frames\". Of course you can!\nThe approach I always take to this scenario (where your view's height is variable) is to declare a yOffset property and based on this I place my content at the right y position. \n@property (nonatomic, assign) int yOffset;\n\nThen inside the init method I initialize this property to either 0 or some predefined initial margin.\n_yOffset = TOP_MARGIN;\n\nThen consider the following scenario: a user profile with n number of skills. This is how you would use the yOffset property.\nfor (int i=0; i<n; ++i) \n{\n    // place the skillView at the right 'y' position\n    SkillView *skillView = [[SkillView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,self.yOffset,300,50)];\n    // configure the skillView here\n    [self.view addSubview:skillView];\n\n    // Don't forget it has to be \"+=\" because you have to keep track of the height!!!\n    self.yOffset += skillView.frame.size.height + MARGIN_BETWEEN_SKILLS;\n}\n\nAnd then imagine the user profile has c number of Education entries; same thing:\nfor (int i=0; i<c; ++i) \n{\n    // place the educationView at the right 'y' position\n    EducationView *educationView = [[EducationView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,self.yOffset,300,50)];\n    // configure the educationView here\n    [self.view educationView];\n\n    // Don't forget it has to be \"+=\" because you have to keep track of the height!!!\n    self.yOffset += educationView.frame.size.height + MARGIN_BETWEEN_EDUCATIONS;\n}\n\nFinally, when all your subviews have been added you have to change the frame of the containing view. (Because when you created it you couldn't know upfront how tall it was going to be)\nCGRect viewFrame = self.view.frame;\nviewFrame.size.height = self.yOffset + BOTTOM_MARGIN;\nself.view.frame = viewFrame;\n\nAnd that's it.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: As you've stated, manually updating the frames is a lot of work and is the old way of doing things. The new better way as you've also said is to use auto layout. Describing how to use auto layout to position your views would require more specific information on how you want it to look but there are some awesome tutorials out there on the web! Here's one of many:\nRay Wenderlich autolayout in iOS 7 part 1\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19595590", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1"}}
{"text": "Q: [wso2][APIM 3.2] conditional engagement of handler does not work I try to write my own WSO2 3.2 APIM Handler.\nMy purpose is :\n\n*\n\n*engage Handler when a dedicated property is set on API\n\n*consume the request and use the binary response to decrypt part of it\n\n*change the content type of the response after decryption\n\nI successfuly write my handler and modify the velocity_template.xml as follow (following the documentation):\n#if($apiObj.additionalProperties.get('encrypted') == \"true\"))\n<handler class=\"org.rudi.wso2.mediation.EncryptedMediaHandler\">\n    <property name=\"encryptedMimeType\" value=\"$apiObj.additionalProperties.get('encrypted_mime_type')\"/>\n    <property name=\"mimeType\" value=\"$apiObj.additionalProperties.get('mime_type')\"/>\n    <property name=\"providerUuid\" value=\"dummy\"/>\n</handler>\n#end\n\nBut this does not work and the handler is not engaged.\nIf I remove the #if condition the handler is engaged but the properties are not interpreted (for exemple the \"mimeType\" field is explicitly set to \"$apiObj.additionalProperties.get('mime_type')\" and not to the value of the additionnalProperty set on API.\nWhat is wrong ?\nHow could I use the additionnal properties added on API ?\nNext when the Handler is called, I did not find any way to read the response of the endpoint.\nI find code to change the response ou the response status code to write fault for exemple\nBut I did not find a way to read the binary response send by my endpoint to work on it.\nHelp will be appreciated!\nUPDATED\nFor the second part of the question, I create a method as follow:\nprivate void replaceBody(SOAPBody body) throws IOException {\n        OMElement element = body.getFirstElement();\n        if (element.getLocalName().equalsIgnoreCase(BINARY_LOCAL_NAME)) {\n            OMNode subChild = element.getFirstOMChild();\n            if (subChild instanceof OMText && ((OMText) subChild).isBinary()) {\n                OMText textNode = ((OMText) subChild);\n                DataHandler originalDataHandler = (DataHandler) textNode.getDataHandler();\n\n                InputStream modifiedInputStream = modify(originalDataHandler.getInputStream());\n\n                DataHandler newDataHandler = new DataHandler(new StreamingOnRequestDataSource(modifiedInputStream ));\n                OMText newTextNode = body.getOMFactory().createOMText(newDataHandler, true);\n\n                textNode.insertSiblingBefore(newTextNode);\n                textNode.detach();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nAnd I lookup for SOAPBody as follow :\norg.apache.axis2.context.MessageContext axis2MC = ((Axis2MessageContext) messageContext)\n                    .getAxis2MessageContext();\nRelayUtils.buildMessage(axis2MC, true);\naxis2MC.setProperty(RelayConstants.FORCE_RESPONSE_EARLY_BUILD, Boolean.TRUE);\nSOAPBody body = axis2MC.getEnvelope().getBody();\n\nI test the behaviour on small file but I think we need to do more stuff to handle big file ou chunked api.\nAny advice?\n\nA: Regarding velocity_template.xml & API Properties Configurations\nThe velocity_template.xml file is used to construct the API Synapse Artifacts to deploy them in the Gateway. As it is a common template file, you have to place your conditions and customizations in the correct sections of the template to reflect in the Synapse Artifact.\nIf you are trying to publish a REST API, then place your code block after this section in the velocity_template.xml\n#foreach($handler in $handlers)\n<handler xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\" class=\"$handler.className\">\n    #if($handler.hasProperties())\n    #set ($map = $handler.getProperties() )\n    #foreach($property in $map.entrySet())\n    <property name=\"$!property.key\" value=\"$!property.value\"/>\n    #end\n    #end\n</handler>\n#end\n\n<!-- place your block here -->\n\nThis makes sure, that your handler is engaged after all mandatory Handlers of the API Managers are engaged. If you want to engage your handler in the middle, then add a condition within #foreach block to append your handler.

{"text": "Q: HTML in MySQL Database -- Best Practices I'm beginning to create a system whereby I (as the only user at present) will be loading a dynamically created PHP page which has a <table> in it.  I then will be grabbing the HTML of that <table> and saving it to be displayed to other users in a separate area of the website.\nMy Questions: What are some best practices to follow for this kind of thing?  Saving the HTML as TEXT or LONGTEXT in MySQL?  BLOB?  Maybe even saving this data as a .txt file which uses PHP include() to include it into the file which displays it to users?\nI'm not really sure of the best approach for this kind of thing, and thus the barrage of questions.  I'm also not very familiar with creating databases and therefore, I'm not knowledgeable as to their strengths/weaknesses.  It seems like using a MySQL database for this is the way to go, but I'm not married to it.\nNote #1: The HTML must be preserved in it's entirety.  So something like <div>Let's use blue for this.</div> can't end up coming out as <div>Let\\'s use blue for this.</div>.  \nNote #2: The table I'm saving from gets randomly generated (including number of rows/columns) each time.  So, I need all data within the table, including all <tr>'s and <td>'s.\n\nA: Both MySQL and HTML files can work. Your choice should depend on how simple the data is, and how much you are storing.\nSome considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed. The HTML files and include() approach is going to be faster. The file system is the fastest, simplest form of data persistence.\n\n*Horizontal scalability. If you adopt the file system approach, you are more or less tied to the disk on that machine. With a separate database engine, you have the future option of running the database on separate cluster servers on the network.\n\n*Meta Data. Do you need to store things like time of creation, which user created the HTML, how many times it has been viewed by other users? If so, you probably only have one realistic choice - a \"proper\" database. This can be MySQL or perhaps one of the NoSQL solutions.\n\n*Data Consumption. Do you show the table in its entirety to other users? Or do you show selected parts of it? Possibly even different parts to different users? This impacts how you store data - the entire table as ONE entity, or each row as an entity, or each individual cell.\n\n*TEXT or LONGTEXT? Of course only applicable if you're going with SQL. The only way to answer this is to know how many bytes you are expecting to store per \"HTML fragment\". Note that your character encoding also impacts the number of bytes stored. Refer to: TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, and LONGTEXT maximum storage sizes\nAlso note that in MySQL, each TEXT/LONGTEXT may also result in an I/O to the disk.\nAs for the concern:\n\nThe HTML must be preserved in its entirety.\n\nAs long as you don't escape the HTML at any point, you should be fine. At first glance, this violates a security best practice, but if you think about it, \"not escaping HTML\" is exactly what you want to do. The practice of escaping HTML output only helps to eliminate HTML syntax being parsed as HTML tags (potential malicious), but in your case, you don't want HTML syntax eliminated at all - you intentionally want <td> to be parsed into an actual HTML table cell. So do not escape anything and the example you gave should never occur.\nJust note: although you do not HTML-escape the output, you still should filter your inputs. In essence, this means: before writing to your DB, check that the user input is indeed HTML. To enhance your application's security, it may also be wise to define rules for what can be stored in those table cells - perhaps no <iframe> or <a> allowed, no style attributes allowed etc. Also, watch out for SQL injection - use PDO and prepared statements if you're going PHP + MySQL.\n\nA: Live by this rule: PHP is for formatting; MySQL is for data.\nPHP is for building HTML.  MySQL is useful as a persistent store for data from which PHP can build HTML.\nI have built several systems with Apache+PHP+MySQL.  Each page is PHP-generated HTML.  I do not store <html tags> in MySQL, only data.\nSome of my pages perform one SELECT; many pages perform a dozen or more.  The performance is just fine.  I use PHP subroutines to build <table>s.  I construct style variations based on the data.\nLet's use blue for this might be in some database table; PHP code would add the <div> tags around it.\n\nA: Someone is going to come up with the php to do this correctly, but here's an idea.\n\n\n*\n\n*Learning a database is a separate exercise that should not be mixed with learning anything else.  Leave MySQL out of this.  If you want to go back and redo the project with it as a learning exercise, after you've spent some time learning the basics, go ahead.\n\n*What you are going to want to do is to generate your table as a separate .php fragment, and then save it to the disk under a unique name that you can use to find it again later (maybe it is a date/time, maybe a number that keeps increasing, maybe a different way).  After it is saved, you can then include it into your page as well as the other pages you want to include it.  Getting that unique name may be a challenge, but that is a different question (and if you look around, probably already has an answer somewhere).\n\n*If you know .php enough, the rest should be self explanatory.  If you don't, then now is an excellent time to learn.  If you have further questions, you can search stack overflow or google for the answers.  Chances are, the answers are out there.\n\n*Since I do know databases, there could be an interesting discussion that the other posters are trying to have with you about how to store the data.  However, that discussion will only be really useful to you once you understand what we are trying to talk about.  Besides, I bet it has already been asked at least once.\n\n\nSo try out that plan and come back and post how you did it for future readers.  Happy coding.\n\nA: What you want to do is absolutely not Three-tier architecture like said Rick James, you are mixing data and presentation.\nBut like in everything, it is up what you want to do and your strategy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Let say, if you are looking to build an application with specific mould of page with a specific space for an image with a specific data at this place and you want to maintain this same architecture for years, you should separate data and presentation. Most of the time, big companies, big applications are looking for this approch. Even if I know some big companies application, we have stored some HTML code in database.\n\n*Now, if you want to be free to change every page design quickly, you can have HTML tag in your database.\nFor example, Wordpress has a lot of HTML tag in its table for years and it is still maintained and used by a lot of people. Saving HTML in database? According to your needs/strategy, it does not schock me.\n\n*And for your information, in Wordpress a HTML post is saved as LONGTEXT.\n\n*In this approach, like Wordpress, you will not have a strong database model, it will be messy and not really relationnal.\n^^\n\nA: I don't know how many tables are you planning to store, but if you don't need to make complicated operations like sorting or filtering you could just store them in files in a folder structure, that will consume less resources than MySQL and the entire file is preserved.\nIf you need many tables then don't store the HTML table, store a json with the info like this:\n[\n    [\n    { \n      \"content\": \"Let's use blue for this.\",\n      \"color\": \"blue\"\n    },\n    { \n      \"content\": \"Let's use red for this.\",\n      \"color\": \"red\"\n    }\n    ],\n    [\n     { \n      \"content\": \"Another row.\",\n      \"color\": \"blue\"\n    },\n     { \n      \"content\": \"Another row.\",\n      \"color\": \"red\"\n    }\n  ]\n]\n\nAnd then rebuild it when you call it. Will use less space and will be faster to transfer.\nIf your tables are in a fixed format, then make a table with the fields you need.\n\nA: I would recommend thinking of your table as a kind of object. SQL tables are meant to store relational data. As such, why not represent the table in that fashion? Below is a really basic example of how you could store a table of People data in SQL.\n<table>\n<thead>\n    <th>People ID</th>\n    <th>First Name</th>\n    <th>Last Name</th>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>John</td>\n        <td>Doe</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>Jane</td>\n        <td>Doe</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n\n\nAnd then your SQL Table would store the encrypted string as follows (using JS):\nfunction utf8_to_b64( str ) {\n  return window.btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent( str )));\n}\n\nfunction b64_to_utf8( str ) {\n  return decodeURIComponent(escape(window.atob( str )));\n}\n\nvar my_table = $('#table').html();\n\n// Store this\nvar encrypted_string = utf8_to_b64(my_table);\n\n// Decode as so\nvar table = b64_to_utf8(encrypted_string);\n\nB64 encoding retrieved from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30696962", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2"}}

But the this.adalService.userInfo.authenticated is still false leading to redirection or again calling login method. So manually setting it to true fixes the redirection error. this.adalService.config.loginResource this is automactically set by adal-angular itself with the resource that we need token for.\nAlso add       expireOffsetSeconds: 320, to adal configuration data settings along with\ntenant: configData.adalConfig.tenant,\n  clientId: configData.adalConfig.clientId,\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin,\n\nexpireoffsetseconds invalidates the token based on the time that we specify before its actual expiry.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49949172", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

{"text": "Q: Primitive derived operations and combinators in EDSL:s I recently flunked an exam, mostly because of a EDSL question. I did not grasp these concepts so I think thats why I failed. I think my teachers explanation was to abstract for me to understand, so I wonder if someone could explain it more clearly. \nI wonder if someone could explain briefly what the components of a EDSL is, and what characterize them. In our course we have gone through Shallow and Deep Embedding of a DSL and looked at the following building blocks for a DSL:\n\n\n*\n\n*Constructor functions\n\n*Combinators (primitive and derived)\n\n*Run functions\n\n\nI think contructor and run functions are more self-explanatory, so Im more interested to understand what makes a Combinator derived or primitive. It doesn\u00b4t hurt if someone will explain the other concepts. Here is an example from our lectures for reference. Its a shallow implemenation of a DSL for creating signals:\nmodule Signal.Shallow\n( Time\n-- | the 'Signal' type is abstract\n, Signal  \n-- * Smart constructors\n, constS, timeS\n-- * Combinators\n, ($$), mapT\n-- * Derived operation\n, mapS\n-- * Run function\n, sample\n) where\n\n-- * Smart constructors\nconstS :: a -> Signal a\ntimeS  ::      Signal Time\n-- * Combinators\n($$)   :: Signal (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b\nmapT   :: (Time -> Time)  -> Signal a -> Signal a\n-- * Derived operation\nmapS   :: (a -> b)        -> Signal a -> Signal b\n-- * Run function\nsample :: Signal a -> Time -> a  \n\ntype Time = Double\nnewtype Signal a = Sig {unSig :: Time -> a}\n\n-- | The constant signal.\nconstS x = Sig (const x)\n\n-- | The time signal\ntimeS = Sig id\n\n-- | Function application lifted to signals.\nfs $$ xs = Sig (\\t -> unSig fs t  (unSig xs t))\n\n\nA: A primitive combinator is one that's built into the DSL, defined in the base language (ie Haskell). DSLs are often built around an abstract type\u2014a type whose implementation is hidden to the end-user. It's completely opaque. The primitive combinators, presented by the language, are the ones that need to know how the abstraction is actually implemented to work.\nA derived combinator, on the other hand, can be implemented in terms of other combinators already in the DSL. It does not need to know anything about the abstract types. In other words, a derived combinator is one you could have written yourself. \nThis is very similar to the idea of primitive types in Haskell itself. For example, you can't implement Int or the Int operations like + yourself. These require things built into the compiler to work because numbers are treated specially. On the other hand, Bool is not primitive; you could write it as a library. \ndata Bool = True | False -- ... you can't do this for Int!\n\n\"Primitive\" and \"derived\" for DSLs is the same idea except the compiler is actually your Haskell library.\nIn your example, Signal is an abstract type. It's implemented as a function Time -> a, but that information is not exported from the module. In the future, you (as the author of the DSL) are free to change how Signal is implemented. (And, in fact, you'd really want to: this is not an efficient representation and using Double for time is finicky.) \nA function like $$ is primitive because it depends on knowing that Signal is Time -> a. When you change the representation of Signal, you'll have to rewrite $$. Moreover, a user of your library wouldn't be able to implement $$ themselves. \nOn the other hand, mapS is a derived operation because it could be written entirely in terms of the other things you're exporting. It does not need to know anything special about Signal and could even be written by one of the users of the library. The implementation could look something like:\nmapS f signal = constS f $$ signal\n\nNote how it uses constS and $$, but never unwraps signal. The knowledge of how to unwrap signal is hidden entirely in those two functions. mapS is \"derived\" because it is written just in your DSL without needing anything below your level of abstraction. When you change the implementation of Signal, mapS will still work as-is: you just need to update constS and $$ properly and you get mapS for free.\nSo: primitive combinators are ones which are built directly into your language and need to know about its internal implementation details. Derived combinators are written purely in terms of your language and do not depend on any of these internal details. They're just convenience functions which could have just as easily been written by the end-user of your library.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25593992", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4"}}

You might have to play with it a few times to get the path right, but this should do what you are wanting to do.\n\nVB.net seem to place my database file into /userprofile/local settings/apps/2.0/data/random/random/appname/data/ folder.\n\nIf you are making an installer then you will want to keep the database close to the application, most likely inside a sub-folder in the application's directory (like the data folder). That is why VS (not VB .Net) tends to place a created database inside of the data folder.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/975454", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}

The user enters some search text into a text field, clicks search, and the code behind creates the appropriate database query using LINQ (searches a table based on the string and returns a limited set of the columns).\nIt then sets the GridView datasource to be the query and calls DataBind().\nprotected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    var query = from record in DB.Table\n                where record.Name.Contains(txtSearch.Text) //Extra string checking etc. removed.\n                select new\n                {\n                    record.ID,\n                    record.Name,\n                    record.Date\n                };\n\n    gvResults.DataSource = query;\n    gvResults.DataBind();\n}\n\nThis works fine.\nWhen a user selects a row in the grid, the SelectedIndexChanged event handler gets the id from the row in the grid (one of the fields), queries the full record from the DB and then populates a set of editor / details fields with the records full details.\nprotected void gvResults_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    int id = int.Parse(gvResults.SelectedRow.Cells[1].Text);\n    DisplayDetails(id);\n}\n\nThis works fine on my local machine where I'm developing the code.

Have I made some naive assumptions, or am I relying on something that is likely to be configured differently in debug?\nLocally I am running an empty asp.net web project in VS2008 to make development quicker. The production server is running the sitecore CMS so is configured rather differently.\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be most welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Check your web.config. Likely the \"AutomaticDataBind\" property is set to \"false\" in one environment, and \"true\" on your dev box.\nI cannot be sure, obviously, but I've been hammered by a similar issue in the past and the symptoms were exactly like you describe here :-)\nP.S. Sitecore defaults this value to false.\n\nA: Having poked around the sitecore forums some more, I came across this blog post explaining one potential solution.\nI added <type>System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView</type> to the <typesThatShouldNotBeExpanded> section of Web.config and it seems to work for us.\nIt seems to be to do with sitecore's page layout rendering pipeline, where it expands sub-layouts and internal placeholders to generate the full page rendering. It accesses the .Net controls on the page and pokes them around a bit, which can cause some controls to not work correctly.\nThere is an article on the SDN about this, although you can only read it if you have an account with sufficient privalegs.

{"text": "Q: Is this a variation of the decorator pattern or a pattern at all? Below is a simplified version of code I've written to override a class method (using composition), in this case method name i'm overriding is addbuttons(); The class \"Screen\" adds buttons to a screen whereas class \"SubScreen\" adds custom buttons to an instance of Screen. Maybe this is not an example of decorator pattern since I'm overriding functionality instead of extending it ? Is there a better way (using a design pattern ?) to achieve same functionality ?\npublic class Driver {\n\n    public static void main(String args[]){\n        AddComponents add1 = new Screen();\n        add1.addButtons();\n\n        Screen newScreen = new Screen();\n        AddComponents add2 = new SubScreen(newScreen);\n        add2.addButtons();\n    }\n\n}\n    public interface AddComponents {\n\n         public void addButtons();\n        }\n\npublic class Screen implements AddComponents{\n\n    public void addButtons() {\n        //Add Buttons to screen class\n    }\n\n}\npublic class SubScreen implements AddComponents{\n\n    private Screen screen;\n\n    public SubScreen(Screen screen){\n        this.screen = screen;\n    }\n\n    public void addButtons() {\n        //add different custom buttons to Screen class\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nA: Another possibility would be to call it Proxy. Decorator and Proxy are technically very similar - the difference is - in most cases - not a technical one but based on the intention.\nYour example is a little bit minimal and therefore it is hard to guess the intention correctly.\nEdit\nAt the detailed level: Screen and SubScreen do not share any code. If you start adding methods to both implementations and the common interface AddComponents you might find \n\n\n*\n\n*that you must duplicate code both in Screen and SubScreen (or delegate to Screen) and\n\n*that you must add methods to AddComponents which make this interface badly named.\n\n\nIf both screen classes are similar both on the abstract logical level and at the implementation level, then a an class AbstractScreen with two derived classed would be better. To bring back pattern speak: Use a Factory Method in AbstractScreen to specialize the behaviour regarding the different buttons.\nOn your current code there is one strange thing: Why is there a method addButton defined anyway? Simply add the buttons in the appropriate constructor, since the user has to call addButtons in any case and the method does not have arguments.\nAnother point not explained is this: SubScreen has a reference to Screen which is not used. Why? Will there be more method in all involved classes Screen, SubScreen and AddComponents? Will each method be a in SubScreen delegate to Screen or only half of them?\nYou see - there are many possibilities we do not know and are not shown in the example code but are very important. I'm sure that your head contains a lot of details saying \"This proposed stuff will not work because I want to do this and that one way or the other in the near future.\" Sadly we cannot get the content of your head into this site without more writing. :-)\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7666972", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "0"}}
